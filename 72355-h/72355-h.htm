<p>
Roger Lawrence had come to town for the
express purpose of doing a certain act, but as the
hour for action approached he felt his ardor rapidly
ebbing.  Of the ardor that comes from hope, indeed,
he had felt little from the first; so little that as he whirled
along in the train he wondered to find himself engaged
in this fool’s errand.  But in default of hope he was
sustained, I may almost say, by despair.  He should fail,
he was sure, but he must fail again before he could rest.
Meanwhile he was restless enough.  In the evening, at
his hotel, having roamed aimlessly about the streets for a
couple of hours in the dark December cold, he went up
to his room and dressed, with a painful sense of having
but partly succeeded in giving himself the figure of an
impassioned suitor.  He was twenty-nine years old, sound
and strong, with a tender heart, and a genius, almost,
for common-sense; his face told clearly of youth and
kindness and sanity, but it had little other beauty.  His
complexion was so fresh as to be almost absurd in a man
of his age,—an effect rather enhanced by a too early
baldness.  Being extremely short-sighted, he went with
his head thrust forward; but as this infirmity is
considered by persons who have studied the picturesque to
impart an air of distinction, he may have the benefit of the
possibility.  His figure was compact and sturdy, and, on
the whole, his best point; although, owing to an incurable
personal shyness, he had a good deal of awkwardness of
movement.  He was fastidiously neat in his person, and
extremely precise and methodical in his habits, which were
of the sort supposed to mark a man for bachelorhood.
The desire to get the better of his diffidence had given
him a certain formalism of manner which many persons
found extremely amusing.  He was remarkable for the
spotlessness of his linen, the high polish of his boots,
and the smoothness of his hat.  He carried in all weathers
a peculiarly neat umbrella.  He never smoked; he
drank in moderation.  His voice, instead of being the
robust barytone which his capacious chest led you to
expect, was a mild, deferential tenor.  He was fond of going
early to bed, and was suspected of what is called “fussing”
with his health.  No one had ever accused him of meanness,
yet he passed universally for a cunning economist.
In trifling matters, such as the choice of a shoemaker or
a dentist, his word carried weight; but no one dreamed
of asking his opinion on politics or literature.  Here and
there, nevertheless, an observer less superficial than the
majority would have whispered you that Roger was an
undervalued man, and that in the long run he would come
out even with the best.  “Have you ever studied his
face?” such an observer would say.  Beneath its simple
serenity, over which his ruddy blushes seemed to pass
like clouds in a summer sky, there slumbered a fund of
exquisite human expression.  The eye was excellent;
small, perhaps, and somewhat dull, but with a certain
appealing depth, like the tender dumbness in the gaze of a
dog.  In repose Lawrence may have looked stupid; but
as he talked his face slowly brightened by gradual fine
degrees, until at the end of an hour it inspired you with
a confidence so perfect as to be in some degree a tribute
to its owner’s intellect, as it certainly was to his integrity.
On this occasion Roger dressed himself with unusual care
and with a certain sober elegance.  He debated for three
minutes over two cravats, and then, blushing in his mirror
at his puerile vanity, he reassumed the plain black tie in
which he had travelled.  When he had finished dressing
it was still too early to go forth on his errand.  He went
into the reading-room of the hotel, but here soon
appeared two smokers.  Wishing not to be infected by
their fumes, he crossed over to the great empty drawing-room,
sat down, and beguiled his impatience with trying
on a pair of lavender gloves.
</p>

<p>
While he was so engaged there came into the room a
person who attracted his attention by the singularity of
his conduct.  This was a man of less than middle age,
good-looking, pale, with a pretentious, pointed mustache
and various shabby remnants of finery.  His face was
haggard, his whole aspect was that of grim and hopeless
misery.  He walked straight to the table in the centre
of the room, and poured out and drank without stopping
three full glasses of ice-water, as if he were striving to
quench some fever in his vitals.  He then went to the
window, leaned his forehead against the cold pane, and
drummed a nervous tattoo with his long stiff finger-nails.
Finally he strode over to the fireplace, flung himself into
a chair, leaned forward with his head in his hands, and
groaned audibly.  Lawrence, as he smoothed down his
lavender gloves, watched him and reflected.  “What an
image of fallen prosperity, of degradation and despair!
I have been fancying myself in trouble; I have been
dejected, doubtful, anxious.  I am hopeless.  But what
is my sentimental sorrow to this?”  The unhappy gentleman
rose from his chair, turned his back to the
chimney-piece, and stood with folded arms gazing at
Lawrence, who was seated opposite to him.  The young man
sustained his glance, but with sensible discomfort.  His
face was as white as ashes, his eyes were as lurid as
coals.  Roger had never seen anything so tragic as the
two long harsh lines which descended from his nose,
beside his mouth, in seeming mockery of his foppish,
relaxed mustache.  Lawrence felt that his companion was
going to address him; he began to draw off his gloves.
The stranger suddenly came towards him, stopped a
moment, eyed him again with insolent intensity, and
then seated himself on the sofa beside him.  His first
movement was to seize the young man’s arm.  “He is
simply crazy!” thought Lawrence.  Roger was now able
to appreciate the pathetic disrepair of his appearance.
His open waistcoat displayed a soiled and crumpled
shirt-bosom, from whose empty buttonholes the studs
had recently been wrenched.  In his normal freshness
he must have looked like a gambler with a run of luck.
He spoke in a rapid, excited tone, with a hard, petulant
voice.
</p>

<p>
“You’ll think me crazy, I suppose.  Well, I shall be
soon.  Will you lend me a hundred dollars?”
</p>

<p>
“Who are you?  What is your trouble?” Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
“My name would tell you nothing.  I’m a stranger
here.  My trouble,—it’s a long story!  But it’s grievous,
I assure you.  It’s pressing upon me with a fierceness
that grows while I sit here talking to you.  A hundred
dollars would stave it off,—a few days at least.  Don’t
refuse me!”  These last words were uttered half as an
entreaty, half as a threat.  “Don’t say you haven’t got
them,—a man that wears such pretty gloves!  Come;
you look like a good fellow.  Look at me!  I’m a good
fellow, too.  I don’t need to swear to my being in
distress.”
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was touched, disgusted, and irritated.  The
man’s distress was real enough, but there was something
horribly disreputable in his manner.  Roger declined to
entertain his request without learning more about him.
From the stranger’s persistent reluctance to do more
than simply declare that he was from St. Louis, and
repeat that he was in a tight place, in a d——d tight place,
Lawrence was led to believe that he had been dabbling
in crime.  The more he insisted upon some definite
statement of his circumstances, the more fierce and
peremptory became the other’s petition.  Lawrence was
before all things deliberate and perspicacious; the last
man in the world to be hustled and bullied.  It was
quite out of his nature to do a thing without distinctly
knowing why.  He of course had no imagination, which,
as we know, should always stand at the right hand of
charity; but he had good store of that wholesome
discretion whose place is at the left.  Discretion told him
that his companion was a dissolute scoundrel, who had
sinned through grievous temptation, perhaps, but who
had certainly sinned.  His misery was palpable, but
Roger felt that he could not patch up his misery without
in some degree condoning his vices.  It was not in his
power, at any rate, to present him, out of hand, a hundred
dollars.  He compromised.  “I can’t think of giving
you the sum you ask,” he said.  “I have no time,
moreover, to investigate your case at present.  If you will
meet me here to-morrow morning, I will listen to
anything you shall have made up your mind to say.
Meanwhile, here are ten dollars.”
</p>

<p>
The man looked at the proffered note and made no
movement to accept it.  Then raising his eyes to Roger’s
face,—eyes streaming with tears of helpless rage and
baffled want,—“O, the devil!” he cried.  “What can I
do with ten dollars?  D—n it, I don’t know how to
beg.  Listen to me!  If you don’t give me what I ask,
I shall cut my throat!  Think of that.  On your head be
the penalty!”
</p>

<p>
Lawrence pocketed his note and rose to his feet.  “No,
decidedly,” he said, “you don’t know how to beg!”  A
moment after, he had left the hotel and was walking
rapidly toward a well-remembered dwelling.  He was
shocked and discomposed by this brutal collision with
want and vice; but as he walked, the cool night-air
suggested sweeter things.  The image of his heated
petitioner was speedily replaced by the calmer figure of
Isabel Morton.
</p>

<p>
He had come to know Isabel Morton three years before,
through a visit she had then made to one of his neighbors
in the country.  In spite of his unventurous tastes
and the even tenor of his habits, Lawrence was by no
means lacking, as regards life, in what the French call <i>les
grandes curiosités</i>; but from an early age his curiosity
had chiefly taken the form of a timid but strenuous desire
to fathom the depths of matrimony.  He had dreamed
of this gentle bondage as other men dream of the “free
unhoused condition” of celibacy.  He had been born a
marrying man, with a conscious desire for progeny.  The
world in this respect had not done him justice.  It had
supposed him to be wrapped up in his petty comforts:
whereas, in fact, he was serving a devout apprenticeship to
the profession of husband and father.  Feeling at twenty-six
that he had something to offer a woman, he allowed
himself to become interested in Miss Morton.  It was
rather odd that a man of tremors and blushes should in
this line have been signally bold; for Miss Morton had
the reputation of being extremely fastidious, and was
supposed to wear some dozen broken hearts on her girdle,
as an Indian wears the scalps of his enemies.
</p>

<p>
It is said that, as a rule, men fall in love with their
opposites; certainly Lawrence’s mistress was not
fashioned in his own image.  He was the most unobtrusively
natural of men; she, on the other hand, was pre-eminently
artificial.  She was pretty, but not really so pretty
as she seemed; clever, but not intelligent; amiable, but
not sympathetic.  She possessed in perfection the manner
of society, which she lavished with indiscriminate grace on
the just and the unjust, and which very effectively rounded
and completed the somewhat meagre outline of her
personal character.  In reality, Miss Morton was keenly
ambitious.  A woman of simpler needs, she might very
well have accepted our hero.  He offered himself with
urgent and obstinate warmth.  She esteemed him more
than any man she had known,—so she told him; but
she added that the man she married must satisfy her
heart.  Her heart, she did not add, was bent upon a
carriage and diamonds.
</p>

<p>
From the point of view of ambition, a match with
Roger Lawrence was not worth discussing.  He was
therefore dismissed with gracious but inexorable
firmness.  From this moment the young man’s sentiment
hardened into a passion.  Six months later he heard
that Miss Morton was preparing to go to Europe.  He
sought her out before her departure, urged his suit
afresh, and lost it a second time.  But his passion had
cost too much to be flung away unused.  During her
residence abroad he wrote her three letters, only one of
which she briefly answered, in terms which amounted
to little more than this: “Dear Mr. Lawrence, do leave
me alone!”  At the end of two years she returned, and
was now visiting her married brother.  Lawrence had
just heard of her arrival, and had come to town to make,
as we have said, a supreme appeal.
</p>

<p>
Her brother and his wife were out for the evening;
Roger found her in the drawing-room, under the lamp,
teaching a stitch in crochet to her niece, a little girl of
ten, who stood leaning at her side.  She seemed to him
prettier than before; although, in fact, she looked older
and stouter.  Her prettiness, for the most part, however,
was a matter of coquetry; and naturally, as youth
departed, coquetry filled the vacancy.  She was fair and
plump, and she had a very pretty trick of suddenly
turning her head and showing a charming white throat and
ear.  Above her well-filled corsage these objects
produced a most agreeable effect.  She always dressed in
light colors, but with unerring taste.  Charming as she
may have been, there was, nevertheless, about her so
marked a want of the natural, that, to admire her
particularly, it was necessary to be, like Roger, in love
with her.  She received him with such flattering
friendliness and so little apparent suspicion of his purpose,
that he almost took heart and hope.  If she did not fear
a declaration, perhaps she desired one.  For the first
half-hour Roger’s attack hung fire.  Isabel talked to
better purpose than before she went abroad, and for the
moment he sat tongue-tied for very modesty.  Miss
Morton’s little niece was a very pretty child; her hair was
combed out into a golden cloud, which covered her sloping
shoulders.  She kept her place beside her aunt,
clasping one of the latter’s hands, and staring at
Lawrence with that sweet curiosity of little girls.  There
glimmered mistily in the young man’s brain a vision of a
home-scene in the future,—a lamp-lit parlor on a winter
night, a placid wife and mother wreathed in household
smiles, a golden-haired child, and, in the midst, his
sentient self, drunk with possession and gratitude.  As the
clock struck nine the little girl was sent to bed, having
been kissed by her aunt and rekissed—or unkissed shall
I say?—by her aunt’s lover.  When she had disappeared
Roger proceeded to business.  He had proposed so
often to Miss Morton, that, actually, practice had begun
to tell.  It took but a few moments to make his meaning
plain.  Miss Morton addressed herself to her niece’s
tapestry, and, as her lover went on with manly eloquence,
glanced up at him from her work with feminine keenness.
He spoke of his persistent love, of his long waiting and
his passionate hope.  Her acceptance of his hand was
the only thing that could make him happy.  He should
never love another woman; if she now refused him, it
was the end of all things; he should continue to exist,
to work and act, to eat and sleep, but he should have
ceased to <i>live</i>.
</p>

<p>
“In Heaven’s name,” he said, “don’t answer me as
you have answered me before.”
</p>

<p>
She folded her hands, and with a serious smile, “I
shall not, altogether,” she said.  “When I have refused
you before, I have simply told you that I could not love
you.  I cannot love you, Mr. Lawrence!  I must repeat
it again to-night, but with a better reason than
before.  I love another man; I am engaged.”
</p>

<p>
Roger rose to his feet like a man who has received
a heavy blow and springs forward in self-defence.  But
he was indefensible, his assailant inattackable.  He sat
down again and hung his head.  Miss Morton came to
him and took his hand and demanded of him, as a right,
that he should be resigned.  “Beyond a certain point,”
she said, “you have no right to thrust your regrets upon
me.  The injury I do you in refusing you is less than
that I should do you in accepting you without love.”
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with his eyes full of tears.  “Well!
I shall never marry,” he said.  “There is something you
cannot refuse me.  Though I shall never possess you, I
may at least espouse your memory and live in intimate
union with your image.  I shall live with my eyes fixed
upon it.”  She smiled at this fine talk; she had heard
so much in her day!  He had fancied himself prepared
for the worst, but as he walked back to his hotel, it
seemed intolerably bitter.  Its bitterness, however,
quickened his temper, and prompted a violent reaction.
He would now, he declared, cast his lot with pure
reason.  He had tried love and faith, but they would none
of him.  He had made a woman a goddess, and she had
made him a fool.  He would henceforth care neither for
woman nor man, but simply for comfort, and, if need
should be, for pleasure.  Beneath this gathered gust of
cynicism the future lay as hard and narrow as the silent
street before him.  He was absurdly unconscious that
good-humor was lurking round the very next corner.
</p>

<p>
It was not till near morning that he was able to sleep.
His sleep, however, had lasted less than an hour when
it was interrupted by a loud noise from the adjoining
room.  He started up in bed, lending his ear to the
stillness.  The sound was immediately repeated; it was
that of a pistol-shot.  This second report was
followed by a loud, shrill cry.  Roger jumped out of
bed, thrust himself into his trousers, quitted his room,
and ran to the neighboring door.  It opened without
difficulty, and revealed an astonishing scene.  In the
middle of the floor lay a man, in his trousers and shirt,
his head bathed in blood, his hand grasping the pistol
from which he had just sent a bullet through his brain.
Beside him stood a little girl in her nightdress, her long
hair on her shoulders, shrieking and wringing her hands.
Stooping over the prostrate body, Roger recognized, in
spite of his bedabbled visage, the person who had
addressed him in the parlor of the hotel.  He had kept the
spirit, if not the letter, of his menace.  “O father,
father, father!” sobbed the little girl.  Roger, overcome
with horror and pity, stooped towards her and opened
his arms.  She, conscious of nothing but the presence
of human help, rushed into his embrace and buried her
head in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the house was immediately aroused, and
the room invaded by a body of lodgers and servants.
Soon followed a couple of policemen, and finally the
proprietor in person.  The fact of suicide was so apparent
that Roger’s presence was easily explained.  From the
child nothing but sobs could be obtained.  After a vast
amount of talking and pushing and staring, after a
physician had affirmed that the stranger was dead, and the
ladies had passed the child from hand to hand through
a bewildering circle of caresses and questions, the
multitude dispersed, and the little girl was borne away in
triumph by the proprietor’s wife, further investigation
being appointed for the morrow.  For Roger, seemingly,
this was to have been a night of sensations.  There
came to him, as it wore away, a cruel sense of his own
accidental part in his neighbor’s tragedy.  His refusal
to help the poor man had brought on the catastrophe.
The idea haunted him awhile; but at last, with an effort,
he dismissed it.  The next man, he assured himself, would
have done no more than he; might possibly have done
less.  He felt, however, a certain indefeasible fellowship
in the sorrow of the little girl.  He lost no time, the
next morning, in calling on the wife of the proprietor.
She was a kindly woman enough, but so thoroughly the
mistress of a public house that she seemed to deal out her
very pity over a bar.  She exhibited toward her protégée
a hard, business-like charity which foreshadowed vividly
to Roger’s mind the poor child’s probable portion in life,
and repeated to him the little creature’s story, as she
had been able to learn it.  The father had come in early
in the evening, in great trouble and excitement, and had
made her go to bed.  He had kissed her and cried over
her, and, of course, made her cry.  Late at night she
was aroused by feeling him again at her bedside, kissing
her, fondling her, raving over her.  He bade her good
night and passed into the adjoining room, where she heard
him fiercely knocking about.  She was very much
frightened; she fancied he was out of his mind.  She knew
that their troubles had lately been thickening fast; now
the worst had come.  Suddenly he called her.  She asked
what he wanted, and he bade her get out of bed and
come to him.  She trembled, but she obeyed.  On reaching
the threshold of his room she saw the gas turned low,
and her father standing in his shirt against the door at
the other end.  He ordered her to stop where she was.
Suddenly she heard a loud report and felt beside her cheek
the wind of a bullet.  He had aimed at her with a pistol.
She retreated in terror to her own bedside and buried her
head in the clothes.  This, however, did not prevent her
from hearing a second report, followed by a deep groan.
Venturing back again, she found her father on the floor,
bleeding from the face.  “He meant to kill her, of course,”
said the landlady, “that she mightn’t be left alone in the
world.  It’s a wonderful mixture of cruelty and kindness!”
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Roger an altogether pitiful tale.  He
related his own interview with the deceased, and the latter’s
menace of suicide.  “It gives me,” he said, “a sickening
sense of connection with this bloodshed.  But how could
I help it?  All the same, I wish he had taken my ten
dollars.”
</p>

<p>
Of the antecedent history of the dead man they could
learn little.  The child had recognized Lawrence, and had
broken out again into a quivering convulsion of tears.
Little by little, from among her sobs, they gathered a few
facts.  Her father had brought her during the preceding
mouth from St. Louis; they had stopped some time in
New York.  Her father had been for months in great
want of money.  They had once had money enough; she
could not say what had become of it.  Her mother had
died many months before; she had no other kindred nor
friends.  Her father may have had friends, but she never
saw them.  She could indicate no source of possible
assistance or sympathy.  Roger put the poor little fragments
of her story together.  The most salient fact among them
all was her absolute destitution.

<p>
“Well, sir,” said the proprietress, “living customers are
better than dead ones; I must go about my business.
Perhaps you can learn something more.”  The little girl
sat on the sofa with a pale face and swollen eyes, and,
with a stupefied, helpless stare, watched her friend depart.
She was by no means a pretty child.  Her clear auburn
hair was thrust carelessly into a net with broken meshes,
and her limbs encased in a suit of rusty, scanty mourning.
In her appearance, in spite of her childish innocence and
grief, there was something undeniably vulgar.  “She
looks as if she belonged to a circus troupe,” Roger said
to himself.  Her face, however, though without beauty,
was not without interest.  Her forehead was symmetrical
and her mouth expressive.  Her eyes were light in color,
yet by no means colorless.  A sort of arrested, concentrated
brightness, a soft introversion of their rays, gave
them a remarkable depth.  “Poor little betrayed,
unfriended mortal!” thought the young man.
</p>

<p>
“What is your name?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“Nora Lambert,” said the child.
</p>

<p>
“How old are you?”
</p>

<p>
“Twelve.”
</p>

<p>
“And you live in St. Louis?”
</p>

<p>
“We used to live there.  I was born there.”
</p>

<p>
“Why had your father come to the East?”
</p>

<p>
“To make money.”
</p>

<p>
“Where was he going to live?”
</p>

<p>
“Anywhere he could find business.”
</p>

<p>
“What was his business?”
</p>

<p>
“He had none.  He wanted to find some.”
</p>

<p>
“You have no friends nor relations?”
</p>

<p>
The child gazed a few moments in silence.  “He told
me when he woke me up and kissed me, last night, that
I had not a friend in the world nor a person that cared
for me.”
</p>

<p>
Before the exquisite sadness of this statement Lawrence
was silent.  He leaned back in his chair and looked at
the child,—the little forlorn, precocious, potential
woman.  His own sense of recent bereavement rose powerful
in his heart and seemed to respond to hers.  “Nora,”
he said, “come here.”
</p>

<p>
She stared a moment, without moving, and then left
the sofa and came slowly towards him.  She was tall for
her years.  She laid her hand on the arm of his chair and
he took it.  “You have seen me before,” he said.  She
nodded.  “Do you remember my taking you last night
in my arms?”  It was his fancy that, for an answer,
she faintly blushed.  He laid his hand on her head and
smoothed away her thick disordered hair.  She submitted
to his consoling touch with a plaintive docility.  He put
his arm round her waist.  An irresistible sense of her
childish sweetness, of her tender feminine promise, stole
softly into his pulses.  A dozen caressing questions rose
to his lips.  Had she been to school?  Could she read
and write?  Was she musical?  She murmured her answers
with gathering confidence.  She had never been to
school; but her mother had taught her to read and write
a little, and to play a little.  She said, almost with a
smile, that she was very backward.  Lawrence felt the
tears rising to his eyes; he felt in his heart the tumult of
a new emotion.  Was it the inexpugnable instinct of
paternity?  Was it the restless ghost of his buried hope?
He thought of his angry vow the night before to live only
for himself and turn the key on his heart.  “From the lips
of babes and sucklings....”—he softly mused.  Before
twenty-four hours had elapsed a child’s fingers were
fumbling with the key.  He felt deliciously contradicted;
he was after all but a lame egotist.  Was he to believe,
then, that he could not live without love, and that he
must take it where he found it?  His promise to Miss
Morton seemed still to vibrate in his heart.  But there
was love and love!  He could be a protector, a father, a
brother.  What was the child before him but a tragic
embodiment of the misery of isolation, a warning from
his own blank future?  “God forbid!” he cried.  And
as he did so, he drew her towards him and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the landlord appeared with a scrap of
paper, which he had found in the room of the deceased;
it being the only object which gave a clew to his
circumstances.  He had evidently burned a mass of papers just
before his death, as the grate was filled with fresh ashes.
Roger read the note, which was scrawled in a hurried,
vehement hand, and ran as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“This is to say that I must—I must—I must!  Starving,
without a friend in the world, and a reputation worse
than worthless,—what can I do?  Life’s impossible.
Try it yourself.  As regards my daughter,—anything,
everything is cruel; but this is the shortest way.”
</p>

<p>
“She has had to take the longest, after all,” said the
proprietor, <i>sotto voce</i>, with a kindly wink at Roger.  The
landlady soon reappeared with one of the ladies who had
been present overnight,—a little pushing, patronizing
woman, who seemed strangely familiar with the various
devices of applied charity.  “I have come to arrange,”
she said, “about our subscription for the little one.  I
shall not be able to contribute myself, but I will go
round among the other ladies with a paper.  I have just
been seeing the reporter of the ‘Universe’; he is to
insert a kind of ‘appeal,’ you know, in his account of the
affair.  Perhaps this gentleman will draw up our paper?
And I think it will be a beautiful idea to take the child
with me.”
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was sickened.  The world’s tenderness had
fairly begun.  Nora gazed at her energetic benefactress,
and then, with her eyes, appealed mutely to Roger.  Her
glance, somehow, moved him to the soul.  Poor little
disfathered daughter,—poor little uprooted germ of
womanhood!  Her innocent eyes seemed to more than
beseech,—to admonish almost, and command.  Should
he speak and rescue her?  Should he subscribe the whole
sum, in the name of human charity?  He thought of the
risk.  She was an unknown quantity.  Her nature, her
heritage, her good and bad possibilities, were an unsolved
problem.  Her father had been an adventurer; what had
her mother been?  Conjecture was useless; she was a
vague spot of light on a dark background.  He was
unable even to decide whether, after all, she was plain.
</p>

<p>
“If you want to take her round with you,” said the
landlady to her companion, “I had better just sponge off
her face.”
</p>

<p>
“No indeed!” cried the other, “she is much better
as she is.  If I could only have her little nightgown
with the blood on it!  Are you sure the bullet didn’t
strike your dress, deary?  I am sure we can easily get
fifty names at five dollars apiece.  Two hundred and fifty
dollars.  Perhaps this gentleman will make it three
hundred.  Come, sir, now!”
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, Roger turned to the child.  “Nora,”
he said, “you know you are quite alone.  You have no
home.”  Her lips trembled, but her eyes were fixed and
fascinated.  “Do you think you could love me?”  She
flushed to the tender roots of her tumbled hair.  “Will
you come and try?”  Her range of expression of course
was limited; she could only answer by another burst of
tears.

<div class='chapter'><h2>II.</h2></div>

<p>
“I have adopted a little girl, you know,” Roger
said, after this, to a number of his friends; but he
felt, rather, as if she had adopted him.  He found
it somewhat difficult to make his terms with the sense of
actual paternity.  It was indeed an immense satisfaction
to feel, as time went on, that there was small danger of
his repenting of his bargain.  It seemed to him more and
more that he had obeyed a divine voice; though indeed he
was equally conscious that there was something comical in
a sleek young bachelor turning nurse and governess.  But
for all this he found himself able to look the world squarely
in the face.  At first it had been with an effort, a blush,
and a deprecating smile that he spoke of his pious venture;
but very soon he began to take a robust satisfaction
in alluding to it freely.  There was but one man of whose
jocular verdict he thought with some annoyance,—his
cousin Hubert Lawrence, namely, who was so terribly
clever and trenchant, and who had been through life a
commentator formidable to his modesty, though, in the end,
always absolved by his good-nature.  But he made up his
mind that, though Hubert might laugh, he himself was
serious; and to prove it equally to himself and his friends,
he determined on a great move.  He withdrew altogether
from his profession, and prepared to occupy his house in
the country.  The latter was immediately transformed
into a home for Nora,—a home admirably fitted to
become the starting-point of a happy life.  Roger’s
dwelling stood in the midst of certain paternal acres,—a
little less than a “place,” a little more than a farm; deep
in the country, and yet at two hours’ journey from
town.  Of recent years a dusty disorder had fallen upon
the house, telling of its master’s long absences and his
rare and restless visits.  It was but half lived in.  But
beneath this pulverous deposit the rigid household gods
of a former generation stand erect on their pedestals.  As
Nora grew older, she came to love her new home with an
almost passionate fondness, and to cherish its transmitted
memories as a kind of compensation for her own obliterated
past.  There had lived with Lawrence for many
years an elderly woman, of exemplary virtue, Lucinda
Brown by name, who had been a personal attendant of
his mother, and since her death had remained in his
service as the lonely warden of his villa.  Roger had an
old-time regard for her, and it seemed to him that her
housewifely gossip might communicate to little Nora a ray of
his mother’s peaceful domestic genius.  Lucinda, who
had been divided between hope and fear as to Roger’s
possibly marrying,—the fear of a diminished empire
having exceeded, on the whole, the hope of company below
stairs,—accepted Nora’s arrival as a very comfortable
compromise.  The child was too young to menace her
authority, and yet of sufficient importance to warrant a
gradual extension of the household economy.  Lucinda
had a vision of new carpets and curtains, of a regenerated
kitchen, of a series of new caps, of her niece coming to
sew.  Nora was the narrow end of the wedge; it would
broaden with her growth.  Lucinda therefore was gracious.
</p>

<p>
For Roger it seemed as if life had begun afresh and
the world had put on a new face.  High above the level
horizon now, clearly defined against the empty sky, rose
this small commanding figure, with the added magnitude
that objects acquire in this position.  She gave him a
great deal to think about.  The child a man begets and
rears weaves its existence insensibly into the tissue of
his life, so that he becomes trained by fine degrees to the
paternal office.  But Roger had to skip experience, and
spring with a bound into the paternal consciousness.  In
fact he missed his leap, and never tried again.  Time
should induct him at leisure into his proper honors,
whatever they might be.  He felt a strong aversion to
claim in the child that prosaic right of property which
belongs to the paternal name.  He eagerly accepted his
novel duties and cares, but he shrank with a tender
humility of temper from all precise definition of his rights.
He was too young and too sensible of his youth to wish
to give this final turn to things.  His heart was flattered,
rather, by the idea of living at the mercy of change
which might always be change for the better.  It lay
close to his heart, however, to drive away the dusky
fears and sordid memories of Nora’s anterior life.  He
strove to conceal the past from her childish sense by a
great pictured screen of present joys and comforts.  He
wished her life to date from the moment he had taken
her home.  He had taken her for better, for worse; but
he longed to quench all baser chances in the daylight
of actual security.  His philosophy in this as in all things
was extremely simple,—to make her happy that she
might be good.  Meanwhile as he cunningly devised her
happiness, his own seemed securely established.  He felt
twice as much a man as before, and the world seemed as
much again a world.  All his small stale merits became
fragrant with the virtue of unselfish use.
</p>

<p>
One of his first acts, before he left town, had been to
divest Nora of her shabby mourning and dress her afresh
in childish colors.  He learned from the proprietor’s wife
at his hotel that this was considered by several ladies
interested in Nora’s fortunes (especially by her of the
subscription) an act of gross impiety; but he held to his
purpose, nevertheless.  When she was freshly arrayed,
he took her to a photographer and made her sit for half
a dozen portraits.  They were not flattering; they gave
her an aged, sombre, lifeless air.  He showed them to
two old ladies of his acquaintance, whose judgment he
valued, without saying whom they represented; the ladies
pronounced her a “fright.”  It was directly after this
that Roger hurried her away to the peaceful, uncritical
country.  Her manner here for a long time remained
singularly docile and spiritless.  She was not exactly sad,
but neither was she cheerful.  She smiled, as if from the
fear to displease by not smiling.  She had the air of a
child who has been much alone, and who has learned
quite to underestimate her natural right to amusement.
She seemed at times hopelessly, defiantly torpid.
“Heaven help me!” thought Roger, as he surreptitiously
watched her: “is she going to be simply stupid?”  He
perceived at last, however, that her listless quietude
covered a great deal of observation, and that growing may
be a very soundless process.  His ignorance of the past
distressed and vexed him, jealous as he was of admitting
even to himself that she had ever lived till now.  He trod
on tiptoe in the region of her early memories, in the dread
of reviving some dormant claim, some ugly ghost.  Yet
he felt that to know so little of her twelve first years was
to reckon without an important factor in his problem;
as if, in spite of his summons to all the fairies for this
second baptism, the godmother-in-chief lurked maliciously
apart.  Nora seemed by instinct to have perceived the
fitness of not speaking of her own affairs, and indeed
displayed in the matter a precocious good taste.  Among
her scanty personal effects the only object referring too
vividly to the past had been a small painted photograph
of her mother, a languid-looking lady in a low-necked
dress, with a good deal of rather crudely rendered
prettiness.  Nora had apparently a timid reserve of
complacency in the fact, which she once imparted to Roger with
a kind of desperate abruptness, that her mother had been
a public singer; and the heterogeneous nature of her
own culture testified to some familiarity with the scenery
of Bohemia.  The common relations of things seemed
quite reversed in her brief experience, and immaturity
and precocity shared her young mind in the freest
fellowship.  She was ignorant of the plainest truths and
credulous of the quaintest falsities; unversed in the commonest
learning and instructed in the rarest.  She barely knew
that the earth is round, but she knew that Leonora is the
heroine of <i>Il Trovatore</i>.  She could neither write nor
spell, but she could perform the most surprising tricks
with cards.  She confessed to a passion for strong green
tea, and to an interest in the romances of the Sunday
newspapers.  Evidently she had sprung from a horribly
vulgar soil; she was a brand snatched from the burning.
She uttered various impolite words with the most
guileless accent and glance, and was as yet equally
unsuspicious of the grammar and the Catechism.  But when
once Roger had straightened out her phrase she was
careful to preserve its shape; and when he had decimated her
vocabulary she made its surviving particles suffice.  For
the rudiments of theological learning, also, she manifested
a due respect.  Considering her makeshift education, he
wondered she was so much of a lady.  His impression of
her father was fatal, ineffaceable; the late Mr. Lambert
had been a blackguard.  Roger had a fancy, however,
that this was not all the truth.  He was free to assume
that the poor fellow’s wife had been of a gentle nurture
and temper; and he even framed on this theme an
ingenious little romance, which gave him a great deal of
comfort.  Mrs. Lambert had been deceived by the
impudent plausibility of her husband, and had come to her
senses amid shifting expedients and struggling poverty,
during which she had been glad to turn to account the
voice which the friends of her happier girlhood had
praised.  She had died outwearied and broken-hearted,
invoking human pity on her child.  Roger established in
this way a sentimental intimacy with the poor lady’s spirit,
and exchanged many a greeting over the little girl’s head
with this vague maternal shape.  But he was by no means
given up to these thin-spun joys; he gave himself larger
satisfactions.  He determined to drive in the first nail
with his own hands, to lay the smooth foundation-stones
of Nora’s culture, to teach her to read and write and
cipher, to associate himself largely with the growth of her
primal sense of things.  Behold him thus converted into
a gentle pedagogue, prompting her with small caresses
and correcting her with smiles.  A moted morning sunbeam
used to enter his little study, and, resting on Nora’s
auburn hair, seemed to make of the place a humming
school-room.  Roger began also to anticipate the future
exactions of preceptorship.  He plunged into a course of
useful reading, and devoured a hundred volumes on
education, on hygiene, on morals, on history.  He drew up
a table of rules and observances for the child’s health;
he weighed and measured her food, and spent hours with
Lucinda, the minister’s wife, and the doctor, in the
discussion of her regimen and clothing.  He bought her a
pony, and rode with her over the neighboring country,
roamed with her in the woods and fields, and picked out
nice acquaintances for her among the little damsels of the
country-side.  A doting granddam, in all this matter,
could not have shown a finer genius for detail.  His zeal
indeed left him very little peace, and Lucinda often
endeavored to assuage it by the assurance that he was
fretting himself away and wearing himself thin on his
happiness.  He passed a dozen times a week from the
fear of coddling and spoiling the child to the fear of
letting her run wild and grow coarse and rustic.  Sometimes
he dismissed her tasks for days together, and kept her
idling at his side in the winter sunshine; sometimes for
a week he kept her within doors, reading to her, preaching
to her, showing her prints, and telling her stories.
She had an excellent musical ear, and the promise of a
charming voice; Roger took counsel in a dozen quarters
as to whether he ought to make her use her voice or spare
it.  Once he took her up to town to a <i>matinée</i> at one of
the theatres, and was in anguish for a week afterwards,
lest he had quickened some inherited tendency to
dissipation.  He used to lie awake at night, trying hard to fix
in his mind the happy medium between coldness and weak
fondness.  With a heart full of tenderness, he used to
measure out his caresses.  He was in doubt for a long
time as to what he should make her call him.  At the
outset he decided instinctively against “papa.”  It was
a question between “Mr. Lawrence” and his baptismal
name.  He weighed the proprieties for a week, and then
he determined the child should choose for herself.  She
had as yet avoided addressing him by name; at last he
asked what name she preferred.  She stared rather
blankly at the time, but a few days afterwards he heard
her shouting “Roger!” from the garden under his
window.  She had ventured upon a small shallow pond
enclosed by his land, and now coated with thin ice.  The
ice had cracked with a great report under her tread, and
was swaying gently beneath her weight, at some yards
from the edge.  In her alarm her heart had chosen, and
her heart’s election was never subsequently gainsaid.
Circumstances seemed to affect her slowly; for a long
time she showed few symptoms of change.  Roger in
his slippers, by the fireside, in the winter evenings, used
to gaze at her with an anxious soul, and wonder whether
it was not only a stupid child that could sit for an
hour by the chimney-corner, stroking the cat’s back
in absolute silence, asking neither questions nor favors.
Then, meeting her intelligent eyes, he would fancy that
she was wiser than he knew; that she was mocking him
or judging him, and counterplotting his pious labors
with elfish subtlety.  Arrange it as he might, he could
not call her pretty.  Plain women are apt to be clever;
might she not (horror of horrors!) turn out too clever?
In the evening, after she had attended Nora to bed,
Lucinda would come into the little library, and she and
Roger would solemnly put their heads together.  In
matters in which he deemed her sex gave her an
advantage of judgment, he used freely to ask her opinion.
She made a great parade of motherly science, rigid
spinster as she was, and hinted by many a nod and wink
at the mystic depths of her sagacity.  As to the child’s
being thankless or heartless, she quite reassured him.
Didn’t she cry herself to sleep, under her breath, on
her little pillow?  Didn’t she mention him every night
in her prayers,—him, and him alone?  However much
her family may have left to be desired as a “family,”—and
of its shortcomings in this respect Lucinda had
an altogether awful sense,—Nora was clearly a lady in
her own right.  As for her plain face, they could wait
awhile for a change.  Plainness in a child was almost
always prettiness in a woman; and at all events, if she
was not to be pretty, she need never be proud.
</p>

<p>
Roger had no wish to remind his young companion of
what she owed him; for it was the very keystone of his
plan that their relation should ripen into a perfect matter
of course; but he watched patiently, as a wandering
botanist for the first woodland violets for the year, for
the shy field-flower of spontaneous affection.  He aimed
at nothing more or less than to inspire the child with a
passion.  Until he had detected in her glance and tone
the note of passionate tenderness his experiment must
have failed.  It would have succeeded on the day when
she should break out into cries and tears and tell him
with a clinging embrace that she loved him.  So he
argued with himself; but, in fact, he expected perhaps
more than belongs to the lame logic of this life.  As a
child, she would be too irreflective to play so pretty a
part; as a young girl, too self-conscious.  I undertake,
however, to tell no secrets.  Roger, being by nature
undemonstrative, continued to possess his soul in
patience.  Nora, meanwhile, seemingly showed as little of
distrust as of positive tenderness.  She grew and grew
in ungrudged serenity.  It was in person, first, that she
began gently, or rather ungently, to expand; acquiring a
well-nurtured sturdiness of contour, but passing quite into
the shambling and sheepish stage of girlhood.  Lucinda
cast about her in vain for possibilities of future beauty,
and took refuge in vigorous attention to the young girl’s
bountiful auburn hair, which she combed and braided
with a kind of fierce assiduity.  The winter had passed
away, the spring was well advanced.  Roger, looking at the
object of his adoption, felt a certain sinking of the heart
as he thought of his cousin Hubert’s visit.  As matters
stood, Nora bore rather livelier testimony to his charity
than to his taste.
</p>

<p>
He had debated some time as to whether he should
write to Hubert and as to how he should write.  Hubert
Lawrence was some four years his junior; but Roger
had always allowed him a large precedence in the things
of the mind.  Hubert had just commenced parson; it
seemed now that grace would surely lend a generous
hand to nature and complete the circle of his
accomplishments.  He was extremely good-looking and clever
with just such a cleverness as seemed but an added
personal charm.  He and Roger had been much together
in early life and had formed an intimacy strangely
compounded of harmony and discord.  Utterly unlike in
temper and tone, they neither thought nor felt nor acted
together on any single point.  Roger was constantly
differing, mutely and profoundly, and Hubert frankly
and sarcastically; but each, nevertheless, seemed to find
in the other an irritating counterpart and complement.
They had between them a kind of boyish levity which
kept them from lingering long on delicate ground; but
they felt at times that they belonged, by temperament, to
irreconcilable camps, and that the more each of them
came to lead his own life, the more their lives would
diverge.  Roger was of a loving turn of mind, and it
cost him many a sigh that a certain glassy hardness of
soul on his cousin’s part was forever blunting the edge
of his affection.  He nevertheless had a deep regard for
Hubert; he admired his talents, he enjoyed his society,
he wrapped him about with his good-will.  He had told
him more than once that he cared for him more than
Hubert would ever believe, could in the nature of things
believe.  He was willing to take his cousin seriously,
even when he knew his cousin was not taking him so.
Hubert, who reserved his faith for heavenly mysteries,
had small credence for earthly ones, and he would
have affirmed that to his perception they loved each
other with a precisely equal ardor, beyond everything in
life, to wit, but themselves.  Roger had in his mind a
kind of metaphysical “idea” of a possible Hubert, which
the actual Hubert took a wanton satisfaction in turning
upside down.  Roger had drawn in his fancy a pure and
ample outline, into which the young ecclesiastic
projected a perversely ill-fitting shadow.  Roger took his
cousin more seriously than the young man took himself.
In fact, Hubert had apparently come into the world to
play.  He played at life, altogether; he played at learning,
he played at theology, he played at friendship; and
it was to be conjectured that, on particular holidays, he
would play pretty hard at love.  Hubert, for some time,
had been settled in New York, and of late they had
exchanged but few letters.  Something had been said about
Hubert’s coming to spend a part of his summer vacation
with his cousin; now that the latter was at the head of
a household and a family, Roger reminded him of their
understanding.  He had finally told him his little
romance, with a fine bravado of indifference to his verdict;
but he was, in secret, extremely anxious to obtain
Hubert’s judgment of the heroine.  Hubert replied that he
was altogether prepared for the news, and that it must
be a very pretty sight to see him at dinner pinning her
bib, or to hear him sermonizing her over a torn frock.
</p>

<p>
“But, pray, what relation is the young lady to me?”
he added.  “How far does the adoption go, and where
does it stop?  Your own proper daughter would be my
cousin; but you can’t adopt for other people.  I shall
wait till I see her; then if she is pleasing, I shall admit
her into cousinship.”
</p>

<p>
He came down for a fortnight, in July, and was soon
introduced to Nora.  She came sidling shyly into the
room, with a rent in her short-waisted frock, and the
“Child’s Own Book” in her hand, with her finger in the
history of “The Discreet Princess.”  Hubert kissed her
gallantly, and declared that he was happy to make her
acquaintance.  She retreated to a station beside Roger’s
knee, and stood staring at the young man.  “<i>Elle a les
pieds énormes</i>,” said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
Roger was annoyed, partly with himself, for he made
her wear big shoes.  “What do you think of him?”
he asked, stroking the child’s hair, and hoping, half
maliciously, that, with the frank perspicacity of
childhood, she would make some inspired “hit” about the
young man.  But to appreciate Hubert’s failings, one
must have had vital experience of them.  At this time,
twenty-five years of age, he was a singularly handsome
youth.  Although of about the same height as his cousin,
the pliant slimness of his figure made him look taller.
He had a cool blue eye and clustering yellow locks.
His features were cut with admirable purity; his teeth
were white, his smile superb.  “I think,” said Nora,
“that he looks like the <i>Prince Avenant</i>.”
</p>

<p>
Before Hubert went away, Roger asked him for a
deliberate opinion of the child.  Was she ugly or
pretty? was she interesting?  He found it hard, however, to
induce him to consider her seriously.  Hubert’s observation
was exercised rather less in the interest of general
truth than of particular profit; and of what profit to
Hubert was Nora’s shambling childhood?  “I can’t
think of her as a girl,” he said: “she seems to me a
boy.  She climbs trees, she scales fences, she keeps
rabbits, she straddles upon your old mare.  I found her
this morning wading in the pond.  She is growing up a
hoyden; you ought to give her more civilizing influences
than she enjoys hereabouts; you ought to engage a
governess, or send her to school.  It is well enough now; but,
my poor fellow, what will you do when she is twenty?”
</p>

<p>
You may imagine, from Hubert’s sketch, that Nora’s
was a happy life.  She had few companions, but during
the long summer days, in woods and fields and orchards,
Roger initiated her into all those rural mysteries
which are so dear to childhood and so fondly remembered
in later years.  She grew more hardy and lively, more
inquisitive, more active.  She tasted deeply of the joy of
tattered dresses and sunburnt cheeks and arms, and long
nights at the end of tired days.  But Roger, pondering
his cousin’s words, began to believe that to keep her
longer at home would be to fail of justice to the <i>ewige
Weibliche</i>.  The current of her growth would soon begin
to flow deeper than the plummet of a man’s wit.  He
determined, therefore, to send her to school, and he
began with this view to investigate the merits of various
seminaries.  At last, after a vast amount of meditation
and an extensive correspondence with the school-keeping
class, he selected one which appeared rich in fair
promises.  Nora, who had never known an hour’s schooling,
entered joyously upon her new career; but she gave her
friend that sweet and long-deferred emotion of which I
have spoken, when, on parting with him, she hung upon
his neck with a sort of convulsive fondness.  He took
her head in his two hands and looked at her; her eyes
were streaming with tears.  During the month which
followed he received from her a dozen letters, sadly
misspelled, but divinely lachrymose.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to relate in detail this phase of Nora’s
history, which lasted two years.  Roger found that he
missed her sadly; his occupation was gone.  Still, her
very absence occupied him.  He wrote her long letters
of advice, told her everything that happened to him, and
sent her books and useful garments, biscuits and oranges.
At the end of a year he began to long terribly to take her
back again; but as his judgment forbade this measure,
he determined to beguile the following year by travel.
Before starting, he went to the little country town which
was the seat of her academy, to bid Nora farewell.  He had
not seen her since she left him, as he had chosen,—quite
heroically, poor fellow,—to have her spend her vacation
with a schoolmate, the bosom friend of this especial
period.  He found her surprisingly altered.  She looked
three years older; she was growing by the hour.
Prettiness and symmetry had not yet been vouchsafed to her;
but Roger found in her young imperfection a sweet
assurance that her account with nature was not yet closed.
She had, moreover, an elusive grace.  She had reached
that charming girlish moment when the crudity of childhood
begins to be faintly tempered by the sense of sex.
She was coming fast, too, into her woman’s heritage of
garrulity.  She entertained him for a whole morning;
she took him into her confidence; she rattled and
prattled unceasingly upon all the swarming little school
interests,—her likes and aversions, her hopes and fears, her
friends and teachers, her studies and story-books.  Roger
sat grinning in high enchantment; she seemed to him
the very genius of girlhood.  For the very first time,
he became conscious of her character; there was an
immense deal of her; she overflowed.  When they parted,
he gave his hopes to her keeping in a long, long kiss.
She kissed him too, but this time with smiles, not with
tears.  She neither suspected nor could she have
understood the thought which, during this interview, had
blossomed in her friend’s mind.  On leaving her, he took a
long walk in the country over unknown roads.  That evening
he consigned his thought to a short letter, addressed
to Mrs. Keith.  This was the present title of the lady
who had once been Miss Morton.  She had married and
gone abroad; where, in Rome, she had done as the
Americans do, and entered the Roman Church.  His
letter ran as follows:—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. KEITH,—I promised you once to be very
unhappy, but I doubt whether you believed me; you did not
look as if you believed me.  I am sure, at all events, you
hoped otherwise.  I am told you have become a Roman
Catholic.  Perhaps you have been praying for me at St. Peter’s.
This is the easiest way to account for my conversion,
to a worthier state of mind.  You know that, two years ago, I
adopted a homeless little girl.  One of these days she will be
a lovely woman.  I mean to do what I can to make her one.
Perhaps, six years hence, she will be grateful enough not to
refuse me as you did.  Pray for me more than ever.  I have
begun at the beginning; it will be my own fault if I have not
a perfect wife.
</p>

<div class='chapter'><h2>III.</h2></div>

<p>
Roger’s journey was long and various.  He went
to the West Indies and to South America, whence,
taking a ship at one of the eastern ports, he
sailed round the Horn and paid a visit to Mexico.  He
journeyed thence to California, and returned home across
the Isthmus, stopping awhile on his upward course at
various Southern cities.  It was in some degree a
sentimental journey.  Roger was a practical man; as he went
he gathered facts and noted manners and customs; but
the muse of observation for him was the little girl at
home, the ripening companion of his own ripe years.  It
was for her sake that he collected impressions and laid
up treasure.  He had determined that she should be a
lovely woman and a perfect wife; but to be worthy of
such a woman as his fancy foreshadowed, he himself had
much to learn.  To be a good husband, one must first
be a wise man; to educate her, he should first educate
himself.  He would make it possible that daily contact
with him should be a liberal education, and that his
simple society should be a benefit.  For this purpose he
should be a fountain of knowledge, a compendium of
experience.  He travelled in a spirit of solemn attention, like
some grim devotee of a former age making a pilgrimage
for the welfare of one he loved.  He kept with great
labor a copious diary, which he meant to read aloud on
the winter nights of coming years.  His diary was
directly addressed to Nora, she being implied throughout
as reader or auditor.  He thought at moments of his
vow to Isabel Morton, and asked himself what had become
of the passion of that hour.  It had betaken itself
to the common limbo of our dead passions.  He rejoiced to
know that she was well and happy; he meant to write
to her again on his return and tell her that he himself
was as happy as she could wish to see him.  He mused
ever and anon on the nature of his affection for Nora,
and wondered what earthly name he could call it by.
Assuredly he was not in love with her: you could not fall
in love with a child.  But if he had not a lover’s love,
he had at least a lover’s jealousy; it would have made
him miserable to believe his scheme might miscarry.  It
would fail, he fondly assured himself, by no fault of hers.
He was sure of her future; in that last interview at
school he had guessed the answer to the riddle of her
formless girlhood.  If he could only be as sure of his
own constancy as of hers!  On this point poor Roger
might fairly have let his conscience rest; but to test his
resolution, he deliberately courted temptation, and on a
dozen occasions allowed present loveliness to measure
itself with absent promise.  At the risk of a large
expenditure of blushes, he bravely incurred the blandishments
of various charming persons of the South.  They failed
signally, in every case but one, to quicken his pulses.
He studied these gracious persons, he noted their gifts
and graces, so that he might know the range of the
feminine charm.  Of the utmost that women can be and do
he wished to have personal experience.  But with the
sole exception I have mentioned, not a syren of them all
but shone with a radiance less magical than that dim
but rounded shape which glimmered forever in the dark
future, like the luminous complement of the early moon.
It was at Lima that his poor little potential Nora suffered
temporary eclipse.  He made here the acquaintance of a
young Spanish lady whose plump and full-blown innocence
seemed to him divinely amiable.  If ignorance is
grace, what a lamentable folly to be wise!  He had
crossed from Havana to Rio on the same vessel with her
brother, a friendly young fellow, who had made him
promise to come and stay with him on his arrival at Lima.
Roger, in execution of this promise, passed three weeks
under his roof, in the society of the lovely Teresita.  She
caused him to reflect, with a good deal of zeal.  She
moved him the more because, being wholly without
coquetry, she made no attempt whatever to interest him.
Her charm was the charm of absolute naïveté, and a
certain tame unseasoned sweetness,—the sweetness of an
angel who is without mundane reminiscences; to say
nothing of a pair of liquid hazel eyes and a coil of
crinkled blue-black hair.  She could barely write her
name, and from the summer twilight of her mind, which
seemed to ring with amorous bird-notes, she flung a
disparaging shadow upon Nora’s prospective condition.
Roger thought of Nora, by contrast, as a kind of superior
doll, a thing wound up with a key, whose virtues would
make a <i>tic-tic</i> if one listened.  Why travel so far about
for a wife, when here was one ready made to his heart,
as illiterate as an angel, and as faithful as the little page
of a mediæval ballad,—and with those two perpetual
love-lights beneath her silly little forehead?
</p>

<p>
Day by day, near the pretty Peruvian, Roger grew
better pleased with the present.  It was so happy, so
idle, so secure!  He protested against the future.  He
grew impatient of the stiff little figure which he had
posted in the distance, to stare at him with those
monstrous pale eyes; they seemed to grow and grow as he
thought of them.  In other words, he was in love with
Teresa.  She, on her side, was delighted to be loved.
She caressed him with her fond dark looks and smiled
perpetual assent.  Late one afternoon they ascended
together to a terrace on the top of the house.  The sun
had just disappeared; the southern landscape was drinking
in the cool of night.  They stood awhile in silence; at last
Roger felt that he must speak of his love.  He walked
away to the farther end of the terrace, casting about in
his mind for the fitting words.  They were hard to find.
His companion spoke a little English, and he a little
Spanish; but there came upon him a sudden perplexing
sense of the infantine rarity of her wits.  He had never
done her the honor to pay her a compliment, he had
never really talked with her.  It was not for him to talk,
but for her to perceive!  She turned about, leaning back
against the parapet of the terrace, looking at him and
smiling.  She was always smiling.  She had on an old faded
pink morning dress, very much open at the throat, and a
ribbon round her neck, to which was suspended a little
cross of turquoise.  One of the braids of her hair had fallen
down, and she had drawn it forward, and was plaiting
the end with her plump white fingers.  Her nails were
not fastidiously clean.  He went towards her.  When he
next became perfectly conscious of their relative
positions, he knew that he had tenderly kissed her, more
than once, and that she had more than suffered him.  He
stood holding both her hands; he was blushing; her
own complexion was undisturbed, her smile barely
deepened; another of her braids had come down.  He was
filled with a sense of pleasure in her sweetness, tempered
by a vague feeling of pain in his all-to-easy conquest.
There was nothing of poor Teresita but that you could
kiss her!  It came upon him with a sort of horror that
he had never yet distinctly told her that he loved her.
“Teresa,” he said, almost angrily, “I love you.  Do
you understand?”  For all answer she raised his two
hands successively to her lips.  Soon after this she went
off with her mother to church.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, one of his friend’s clerks brought
him a package of letters from his banker.  One of them
was a note from Nora.  It ran as follows:—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR ROGER: I want so much to tell you that I have just
got the prize for the piano.  I hope you will not think it very
silly to write so far only to tell you this.  But I am so proud
I want you to know it.  Of the three girls who tried for it,
two were seventeen.  The prize is a beautiful picture called
“Mozart à Vienne”; probably you have seen it.  Miss Murray
says I may hang it up in my bedroom.  Now I have got to go
and practise, for Miss Murray says I must practise more than
ever.  My dear Roger, I do hope you are enjoying your travels.
I have learned a great deal of geography, following you on the
map.  Don’t ever forget your loving     NORA.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After reading this letter, Roger told his host that he
should have to leave him.  The young Peruvian demurred,
objected, and begged for a reason.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Roger, “I find I am in love with your
sister.”  The words sounded on his ear as if someone else
had spoken them.  Teresita’s light was quenched, and she
had no more fascination than a smouldering lamp,
smelling of oil.
</p>

<p>
“Why, my dear fellow,” said his friend, “that seems
to me a reason for staying.  I shall be most happy to
have you for a brother-in-law.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s impossible!  I am engaged to a young lady in
my own country.”
</p>

<p>
“You are in love here, you are engaged there, and you
go where you are engaged!  You Englishmen are strange
fellows!”
</p>

<p>
“Tell Teresa that I adore her, but that I am pledged
at home.  I would rather not see her.”
</p>

<p>
And so Roger departed from Lima, without further
communion with Teresita.  On, his return home he
received a letter from her brother, telling him of her
engagement to a young merchant of Valparaiso,—an
excellent match.  The young lady sent him her salutations.
Roger, answering his friend’s letter, begged that
the Doña Teresa would accept, as a wedding-present, of
the accompanying trinket,—a little brooch in turquoise.
It would look very well with pink!
</p>

<p>
Roger reached home in the autumn, but left Nora at
school till the beginning of the Christmas holidays.  He
occupied the interval in refurnishing his house, and clearing
the stage for the last act of the young girl’s childhood.
He had always possessed a modest taste for upholstery;
he now began to apply it under the guidance of a delicate
idea.  His idea led him to prefer, in all things, the fresh
and graceful to the grave and formal, and to wage war
throughout his old dwelling on the lurking mustiness of
the past.  He had a lively regard for elegance, balanced
by a horror of wanton luxury.  He fancied that a woman
is the better for being well dressed and well domiciled,
and that vanity, too stingily treated, is sure to avenge
itself.  So he took vanity into account.  Nothing
annoyed him more, however, than the fear of seeing Nora
a precocious fine lady; so that while he aimed at all
possible purity of effect, he stayed his hand here and there
before certain admonitory relics of ancestral ugliness and
virtue, embodied for the most part in hair-cloth and
cotton damask.  Chintz and muslin, flowers and
photographs and books, gave their clear light tone to the
house.  Nothing could be more tenderly propitious and
virginal, or better chosen both to chasten the young girl’s
aspirations and to remind her of her protector’s tenderness.
</p>

<p>
Since his return he had designedly refused himself a
glimpse of her.  He wished to give her a single undivided
welcome to his home and his heart.  Shortly before
Christmas, as he had even yet not set his house in order,
Lucinda Brown was sent to fetch her from school.  If
Roger had expected that Nora would return with any
striking accession of beauty, he would have had to say
“Amen” with an effort.  She had pretty well ceased to
be a child; she was still his grave, imperfect Nora.  She
had gained her full height,—a great height, which her
young strong slimness rendered the more striking.  Her
slender throat supported a head of massive mould, bound
about with dense auburn braids.  Beneath a somewhat
serious brow her large, fair eyes retained their collected
light, as if uncertain where to fling it.  Now and then
the lids parted widely and showered down these gathered
shafts; and if at these times a certain rare smile divided,
in harmony, her childish lips, Nora was for the moment
a passable beauty.  But for the most part, the best charm
of her face was in a modest refinement of line, which
rather evaded notice than courted it.  The first
impression she was likely to produce was of a kind of awkward
slender majesty.  Roger pronounced her “stately,” and
for a fortnight thought her too imposing by half; but
as the days went on, and the pliable innocence of early
maidenhood gave a soul to this formidable grace, he
began to feel that in essentials she was still the little
daughter of his charity.  He even began to observe in
her an added consciousness of this lowly position; as if
with the growth of her mind she had come to reflect upon
it, and deem it less and less a matter of course.  He
meditated much as to whether he should frankly talk it
over with her and allow her to feel that, for him as well,
their relation could never become commonplace.  This
would be in a measure untender, but would it not be
prudent?  Ought he not, in the interest of his final
purpose, to infuse into her soul in her sensitive youth an
impression of all that she owed him, so that when his time
had come, if her imagination should lead her a-wandering,
gratitude would stay her steps?  A dozen times over he
was on the verge of making his point, of saying, “Nora,
Nora, these are not vulgar alms; I expect a return.  One
of these days you must pay your debt.  Guess my riddle!
I love you less than you think—and more!  A word to
the wise.”  But he was silenced by a saving sense of
the brutality of such a course and by a suspicion that,
after all, it was not needful.  A passion of gratitude was
silently gathering in the young girl’s heart: that heart
could be trusted to keep its engagements.  A deep
conciliatory purpose seemed now to pervade her life, of
infinite delight to Roger as little by little it stole upon his
mind like the fragrance of a deepening spring.  He had
his idea; he suspected that she had hers.  They were
but opposite faces of the same deep need.  Her musing
silence, her deliberate smiles, the childish keenness of her
questionings, the delicacy of her little nameless services
and caresses, were all a kind of united acknowledgment
and promise.
</p>

<p>
On Christmas eve they sat together alone by a blazing
log-fire in Roger’s little library.  He had been reading
aloud a chapter of his diary, to which Nora sat listening
in dutiful demureness, though her thoughts evidently
were nearer home than Cuba and Peru.  There is no
denying it was dull; he could gossip to better purpose.
He felt its dulness himself, and closing it finally with
good-humored petulance, declared it was fit only to throw
into the fire.  Upon which Nora looked up, protesting.
“You must do no such thing,” she said.  “You must
keep your journals carefully, and one of these days I
shall have them bound in morocco and gilt, and ranged
in a row in my own bookcase.”
</p>

<p>
“That is but a polite way of burning them up,” said
Roger.  “They will be as little read as if they were in
the fire.  I don’t know how it is.  They seemed to be
very amusing when I wrote them: they are as stale as
an old newspaper now.  I can’t write: that’s the amount
of it.  I am a very stupid fellow, Nora; you might as
well know it first as last.”
</p>

<p>
Nora’s school had been of the punctilious Episcopal
order, and she had learned there the pretty custom of
decorating the house at Christmas-tide with garlands and
crowns of evergreen and holly.  She had spent the day
in decking out the chimney-piece, and now, seated on a
stool under the mantel-shelf, she twisted the last little
wreath which was to complete her design.  A great still
snow-storm was falling without, and seemed to be blocking
them in from the world.  She bit off the thread with
which she had been binding her twigs, held out her
garland to admire its effect, and then, “I don’t believe you
are stupid, Roger,” she said: “and if I did, I should not
much care.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that philosophy, or indifference?” said the young
man.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know that it’s either; it’s because I know
you are so good.”
</p>

<p>
“That is what they say about all stupid people.”
</p>

<p>
Nora added another twig to her wreath and bound it
up.  “I am sure,” she said at last, “that when people
are as good as you are, they cannot be stupid.  I should
like some one to tell me you are stupid.  I know, Roger;
<i>I</i> know!”
</p>

<p>
The young man began to feel a little uneasy; it was
no part of his plan that her good-will should spend itself
too soon.  “Dear me, Nora, if you think so well of me,
I shall find it hard to live up to your expectations.  I am
afraid I shall disappoint you.  I have a little gimcrack
to put in your stocking to-night; but I’m rather ashamed
of it now.”
</p>

<p>
“A gimcrack more or less is of small account.  I have
had my stocking hanging up these three years, and
everything I possess is a present from you.”
</p>

<p>
Roger frowned; the conversation had taken just such
a turn as he had often longed to provoke, but now it was
disagreeable to him.  “O, come,” he said: “I have done
simply my duty to my little girl.”
</p>

<p>
“But, Roger,” said Nora, staring with expanded eyes,
“I am not your little girl.”
</p>

<p>
His frown darkened; his heart began to beat.  “Don’t
talk nonsense!” he said.
</p>

<p>
“But, Roger, it is true.  I am no one’s little girl.
Do you think I have no memory?  Where is my father?
Where is my mother?”
</p>

<p>
“Listen to me,” said Roger, sternly.  “You must
not talk of such things.”
</p>

<p>
“You must not forbid me, Roger.  I can’t think of
them without thinking of you.  This is Christmas eve!
Miss Murray told us that we must never let it pass
without thinking of all that it means.  But without Miss
Murray, I have been thinking all day of things which
are hard to name,—of death and life, of my parents and
you, of my incredible happiness.  I feel to-night like a
princess in a fairy-tale.  I am a poor creature, without a
friend, without a penny or a home; and yet, here I sit
by a blazing fire, with money, with food, with clothes,
with love.  The snow outside is burying the stone-walls,
and yet here I can sit and simply say, ‘How pretty!’  Suppose
I were in it, wandering and begging,—I might
have been!  Should I think it pretty then?  Roger,
Roger, I am no one’s child!”  The tremor in her voice
deepened, and she broke into a sudden passion of tears.
Roger took her in his arms and tried to soothe away her
sobs.  But she disengaged herself and went on with an
almost fierce exaltation: “No, no, I won’t be comforted!
I have had comfort enough; I hate it.  I want for an
hour to be myself and feel how little that is, to be my
miserable father’s daughter, to fancy I hear my mother’s
voice.  I have never spoken of them before; you must
let me to-night.  You must tell me about my father; you
know something.  I don’t.  You never refused me
anything, Roger; don’t refuse me this.  He was not good,
like you; but now he can do no harm.  You have never
mentioned his name to me, but happy as we are here
together, we ought not,—we ought not, to despise him!”
</p>

<p>
Roger yielded to the vehemence of this flood of
emotion.  He stood watching her with two helpless tears in
his own eyes, and then he drew her gently towards him
and kissed her on the forehead.  She took up her work
again, and he told her, with every minutest detail he
could recall, the story of his sole brief interview with
Mr. Lambert.  Gradually he lost the sense of effort and
reluctance, and talked freely, abundantly, almost with pleasure.
Nora listened very solemnly,—with an amount of self-control
which denoted the habit of constant retrospect.
She asked a hundred questions as to Roger’s impression of
her father’s appearance.  Was he not wonderfully
handsome?  Then taking up the tale herself, she poured out
a torrent of feverish reminiscence.  She disinterred her
early memories with a kind of rapture of relief.  Her
evident joy in this frolic of confidence gave Roger a
pitying sense of what her long silence must have cost
her.  But evidently she bore him no grudge, and his
present tolerance of her rambling gossip seemed to her
but another proof of his charity.  She rose at last, and
stood before the fire, into which she had thrown the
refuse of her greenery, watching it blaze up and turn to
ashes.  “So much for the past!” she said, at last.
“The rest is the future.  The girls at school used to be
always talking about what they meant to do in coming
years, what they hoped, what they wished; wondering,
choosing, imagining.  You don’t know how girls talk,
Roger: you would be surprised!  I never used to say
much: my future is fixed.  I have nothing to choose,
nothing to hope, nothing to fear.  I am to make you
happy.  That’s simple enough.  You have undertaken
to bring me up, Roger; you must do your best, because
now I am here, it’s for long, and you would rather have
a wise girl than a silly one.”  And she smiled with a
kind of tentative daughterliness through the traces of
her recent grief.  She put her two hands on his
shoulders and eyed him with conscious gravity.  “You shall
never repent.  I shall learn everything, I shall be
everything!  Oh!  I wish I were pretty.”  And she tossed
back her head, in impatience of her fatal plainness, with
an air which forced Roger to assure her that she would
do very well as she was.  “If you are satisfied,” she
said, “I am!”  For a moment Roger felt as if she were
twenty years old.
</p>

<p>
This serious Christmas eve left its traces upon many
ensuing weeks.  Nora’s education was resumed with a
certain added solemnity.  Roger was no longer obliged
to condescend to the level of her intelligence, and he
found reason to thank his stars that he had improved
his own mind.  He found use for all the knowledge he
possessed.  The day of childish “lessons” was over,
and Nora sought instruction in the perusal of various
classical authors, in her own and other tongues, in
concert with her friend.  They read aloud to each other
alternately, discussed their acquisitions, and digested
them with perhaps equal rapidity.  Roger, in former
years, had had but a small literary appetite; he liked a
few books and knew them well, but he felt as if to settle
down to an unread author were very like starting on a
journey,—a case for farewells, packing trunks, and
buying tickets.  His curiosity, now, however, imbued and
quickened with a motive, led him through a hundred
untrodden paths.  He found it hard sometimes to keep
pace with Nora’s pattering step; through the flowery
lanes of poetry, in especial, she would gallop without
drawing breath.  Was she quicker-witted than her friend,
or only more superficial?  Something of one, doubtless,
and something of the other.  Roger was forever
suspecting her of a deeper penetration than his own, and
hanging his head with an odd mixture of pride and
humility.  Her quick perception, at times, made him feel
irretrievably dull and antiquated.  His ears would tingle,
his cheeks would burn, his old hope would fade into a
shadow.  “It’s worse than useless,” he would declare.
“How can I ever have for her that charm of infallibility,
that romance of omniscience, that a woman demands of
her lover?  She has seen me scratching my head, she has
seen me counting on my fingers!  Before she is seventeen
she will be mortally tired of me, and by the time
she is twenty I shall be fatally familiar and incurably
stale.  It’s very well for her to talk about life-long
devotion and eternal gratitude.  She doesn’t know the
meaning of words.  She must grow and outgrow, that
is her first necessity.  She must come to woman’s estate
and pay the inevitable tribute.  I can open the door and
let in the lover.  If she loves me now I shall have had
my turn.  I can’t hope to be the object of two passions.
I must thank the Lord for small favors!”  Then as he
seemed to taste, in advance, the bitterness of disappointment,
casting about him angrily for some means of appeal:
“I ought to go away and stay away for years
and never write at all, instead of compounding ponderous
diaries to make even my absence detestable.  I ought to
convert myself into a beneficent shadow, a vague
tutelary name.  Then I ought to come back in glory,
fragrant with exotic perfumes and shod with shoes of
mystery!  Otherwise, I ought to clip the wings of her
fancy and put her on half-rations.  I ought to snub her
and scold her and bully her and tell her she’s deplorably
plain,—treat her as Rochester treats Jane Eyre.  If I
were only a good old Catholic, that I might shut her up
in a convent and keep her childish and stupid and
contented!”  Roger felt that he was too doggedly
conscientious; but abuse his conscience as he would, he could
not make it yield an inch; so that in the constant strife
between his egotistical purpose and his generous temper,
the latter kept gaining ground, and Nora innocently
enjoyed the spoils of victory.  It was his very generosity
that detained him on the spot, by her side, watching her,
working for her, performing a hundred offices which
other hands would have but scanted.  Roger watched
intently for the signs of that inevitable hour when a young
girl begins to loosen her fingers in the grasp of a
guiding hand and wander softly in pursuit of the sinuous
silver thread which deflects, through meadows of perennial
green, from the dull gray stream of the common lot.
She had relapsed in the course of time into the careless
gayety and the light, immediate joys of girlhood.  If she
cherished a pious purpose in her heart, she made no
indecent parade of it.  But her very placidity and patience
somehow afflicted her friend.  She was too monotonously
sweet, too easily obedient.  If once in a while she
would only flash out into petulance or rebellion!  She
kept her temper so carefully: what in the world was she
keeping it for?  If she would only bless him for once
with an angry look and tell him that he bored her!
</p>

<p>
During the second year after her return from school
Roger began to imagine that she avoided his society
and resented his attentions.  She was fond of lonely
walks, readings, reveries.  She was fond of novels, and
she read a great many.  For works of fiction in general
Roger had no great relish, though he confessed to three
or four old-fashioned favorites.  These were not always
Nora’s.  One evening in the early spring she sat down
to a twentieth perusal of the classic tale of “The Heir of
Redcliffe.”  Roger, as usual, asked her to read aloud.
She began, and proceeded through a dozen pages.
Looking up, at this point, she beheld Roger asleep.
She smiled softly, and privately resumed her reading.
At the end of an hour, Roger, having finished his nap,
rather startled her by his excessive annoyance at his
lapse of consciousness.  He wondered whether he had
snored, but the absurd fellow was ashamed to ask her.
Recovering himself finally, “The fact is, Nora,” he
said, “all novels seem to me stupid.  They are nothing
to what <i>I</i> can fancy!  I have in my heart a prettier
romance than any of them.”
</p>

<p>
“A romance?” said Nora, simply.  “Pray let me hear
it.  You are quite as good a hero as this stick of a Philip.
Begin!”
</p>

<p>
He stood before the fire, looking at her with almost
funereal gravity.  “My dénouement is not yet written,”
he said.  “Wait till the story is finished; then you shall
hear the whole.”
</p>

<p>
As at this time Nora put on long dresses and began to
arrange her hair as a young lady, it occurred to Roger
that he might make some change in his own appearance
and reinforce his waning attractions.  He was now
thirty-three; he fancied he was growing stout.  Bald, corpulent,
middle-aged,—at this rate he should soon be shelved!
He was seized with a mad desire to win back the lost
graces of youth.  He had a dozen interviews with his
tailor, the result of which was that for a fortnight he
appeared daily in a new garment.  Suddenly, amid this
restless longing to revise and embellish himself, he
determined to suppress his whiskers.  This would take off five
years.  He appeared, therefore, one morning, in the severe
simplicity of a mustache.  Nora started, and greeted
him with a little cry of horror.  “Don’t you like it?”
he asked.
</p>

<p>
She hung her head on one side and the other.  “Well,
no,—to be frank.”
</p>

<p>
“O, of course to be frank!  It will only take five
years to grow them again.  What is the trouble?”
</p>

<p>
She gave a critical frown.  “It makes you look too,—too
fat; too much like Mr. Vose.”  It is sufficient to
explain that Mr. Vose was the butcher, who called every
day in his cart, and who recently,—Roger with horror
only now remembered it,—had sacrificed his whiskers to
a mysterious ideal.
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry!” said Roger.  “It was for you I did it!”
</p>

<p>
“For me!”  And Nora burst into a violent laugh.
</p>

<p>
“Why, my dear Nora,” cried the young man with a
certain angry vehemence, “don’t I do everything in life
for you?”
</p>

<p>
She became grave again.  Then, after much meditation,
“Excuse my unfeeling levity,” she said.  “You might
cut off your nose, Roger, and I should like your face as
well.”  But this was but half comfort.  “Too fat!”  Her
subtler sense had spoken, and Roger never encountered
Mr. Vose for three months after this without wishing
to attack him with one of his own cleavers.
</p>

<p>
He made now an heroic attempt to scale the frowning
battlements of the future.  He pretended to be making
arrangements for a tour in Europe, and for having his
house completely remodelled in his absence; noting the
while attentively the effect upon Nora of his cunning
machinations.  But she gave no sign of suspicion that
his future, to the uttermost day, could be anything but
her future too.  One evening, nevertheless, an incident
occurred which fatally confounded his calculations,—an
evening of perfect mid-spring, full of warm, vague odors,
of growing daylight, of the sense of bursting sap and
fresh-turned earth.  Roger sat on the piazza, looking out
on these things with an opera-glass.  Nora, who had been
strolling in the garden, returned to the house and sat
down on the steps of the portico.  “Roger,” she said,
after a pause, “has it never struck you as very strange
that we should be living together in this way?”
</p>

<p>
Roger’s heart rose to his throat.  But he was loath to
concede anything, lest he should concede too much.  “It
is not especially strange,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Surely it is strange,” she answered.  “What are you?
Neither my brother, nor my father, nor my uncle, nor my
cousin,—nor even, by law, my guardian.”
</p>

<p>
“By law!  My dear child, what do you know about law?”
</p>

<p>
“I know that if I should run away and leave you now,
you could not force me to return.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s fine talk!  Who told you that?”
</p>

<p>
“No one; I thought of it myself.  As I grow older,
I ought to think of such things.”
</p>

<p>
“Upon my word!  Of running away and leaving me?”
</p>

<p>
“That is but one side of the question.  The other is
that you can turn me out of your house this moment, and
no one can force you to take me back.  I ought to
remember such things.”
</p>

<p>
“Pray what good will it do you to remember them?”
</p>

<p>
Nora hesitated a moment.  “There is always some
good in not losing sight of the truth.”
</p>

<p>
“The truth!  You are very young to begin to talk
about the truth.”
</p>

<p>
“Not too young.  I am old for my age.  I ought to
be!”  These last words were uttered with a little sigh
which roused Roger to action.
</p>

<p>
“Since we are talking about the truth,” he said, “I
wonder whether you know a tithe of it.”
</p>

<p>
For an instant she was silent; then, rising slowly to
her feet, “What do you mean?” she asked.  “Is there
any secret in all that you have done for me?”  Suddenly
she clasped her hands, and eagerly, with a smile, went on:
“You said the other day you had a romance.  Is it a real
romance, Roger?  Are you, after all, related to me,—my
cousin, my brother?”
</p>

<p>
He let her stand before him, perplexed and expectant.
“It is more of a romance than that.”
</p>

<p>
She slid upon her knees at his feet.  “Dear Roger, do
tell me,” she said.
</p>

<p>
He began to stroke her hair.  “You think so much,”
he answered: “do you never think about the future, the
real future, ten years hence?”
</p>

<p>
“A great deal.”
</p>

<p>
“What do you think?”
</p>

<p>
She blushed a little, and then he felt that she was
drawing confidence from his face.  “Promise not to
laugh!” she said, half laughing herself.  He nodded.
“I think about my husband!” she proclaimed.  And
then, as if she had, after all, been very absurd, and to
forestall his laughter, “And about your wife!” she
quickly added.  “I want dreadfully to see her.  Why
don’t you marry?”
</p>

<p>
He continued to stroke her hair in silence.  At last he
said sententiously, “I hope to marry one of these days.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish you would do it now,” Nora went on.  “If
only she would be nice!  We should be sisters, and I
should take care of the children.”
</p>

<p>
“You are too young to understand what you say, or
what I mean.  Little girls should not talk about marriage.
It can mean nothing to you until you come yourself to
marry,—as you will, of course.  You will have to decide
and choose.”
</p>

<p>
“I suppose I shall.  I shall refuse him.”
</p>

<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>

<p>
But, without answering his question, “Were you ever
in love, Roger?” she suddenly asked.  “Is that your
romance?”
</p>

<p>
“Almost.”
</p>

<p>
“Then it is not about me, after all?”
</p>

<p>
“It is about you, Nora; but, after all, it is not a romance.
It is solid, it is real, it is truth itself; as true as
your silly novels are false.  Nora, I care for no one, I
shall never care for any one, but you!”
</p>

<p>
He spoke in tones so deep and solemn that she was
impressed.  “Do you mean, Roger, that you care so much
for me that you will never marry?”
</p>

<p>
He rose quickly in his chair, pressing his hand over
his brow.  “Ah, Nora,” he cried, “you are very painful!”
</p>

<p>
If she had annoyed him she was very contrite.  She
took his two hands in her own.  “Roger,” she whispered
gravely, “if you don’t wish it, I promise never,
never, never to marry, but to be yours alone,—yours
alone!”
</p>

<div class='chapter'><h2>IV.</h2></div>

<p>
The summer passed away; Nora was turned sixteen.
Deeming it time she should begin to see
something of the world, Roger spent the autumn
in travelling.  Of his tour in Europe he had ceased to talk;
it was indefinitely deferred.  It matters little where they
went; Nora greatly enjoyed the excursion, and found all
spots alike delightful.  To Roger himself it gave a great
deal of comfort.  Whether or no his companion was pretty,
people certainly looked at her.  He overheard them a
dozen times call her “striking.”  <i>Striking</i>!  The word
seemed to him rich in meaning; if he had seen her for
the first time taking the breeze on the deck of a river
steamer, he certainly should have been struck.  On his
return home he found among his letters the following
missive:—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR SIR: I have learned, after various fruitless
researches, that you have adopted my cousin.  Miss Lambert, at
the time she left St. Louis, was too young to know much about
her family, or even to care much; and you, I suppose, have not
investigated the subject.  You, however, better than any one,
can understand my desire to make her acquaintance.  I hope
you will not deny me the privilege.  I am the second son of a
half-sister of her mother, between whom and my own mother
there was always the greatest affection.  It was not until some
time after it happened that I heard of Mr. Lambert’s melancholy
death.  But it is useless to recur to that painful scene!
I resolved to spare no trouble in ascertaining the fate of his
daughter.  I have only just succeeded, after having almost
given her up.  I have thought it better to write to you than to
her, but I beg you to give her my compliments.  I anticipate
no difficulty in satisfying you that I am not an impostor.  I
have no hope of being able to better her circumstances; but,
whatever they may be, blood is blood, and cousins are cousins,
especially in the West.  A speedy answer will oblige
</p>

<p class="letter">
  Yours truly,<br>
              GEORGE FENTON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The letter was dated in New York, from an hotel.
Roger felt a certain dismay.  It had been from the first
a peculiar satisfaction to him that Nora began and ended
so distinctly with herself.  But here was a hint of
indefinite continuity!  Here, at last, was an echo of her past.
He immediately showed the letter to Nora.  As she read
it, her face flushed deep with wonder and suppressed
relief.  She had never heard, she confessed, of her mother’s
half-sister.  The “great affection” between the two
ladies must have been anterior to Mrs. Lambert’s marriage.
Roger’s own provisional solution of the problem was that
Mrs. Lambert had married so little to the taste of her
family as to forfeit all communication with them.  If he
had obeyed his first impulse, he would have written to his
mysterious petitioner that Miss Lambert was sensible of
the honor implied in his request, but that never having
missed his attentions, it seemed needless that, at this time
of day, she should cultivate them.  But Nora was
interested in Mr. Fenton; the dormant pulse of kinship had
been quickened; it began to throb with delicious power.
This was enough for Roger.  “I don’t know,” he said,
“whether he’s an honest man or a scamp, but at a
venture I suppose I must invite him down.”  To this Nora
replied that she thought his letter was “so beautiful”;
and Mr. Fenton received a fairly civil summons.
</p>

<p>
Whether or no he was an honest man remained to be
seen; but on the face of the matter he appeared no scamp.
He was, in fact, a person difficult to classify.  Roger had
made up his mind that he would be outrageously rough
and Western; full of strange oaths and bearded, for
aught he knew, like the pard.  In aspect, however,
Fenton was a pretty fellow enough, and his speech, if not
especially conciliatory to ears polite, possessed a certain
homely vigor in which ears polite might have found their
account.  He was as little as possible, certainly, of
Roger’s circle; but he carried about him the native
fragrance of another circle, beside which the social
perfume familiar to Roger’s nostrils might have seemed a
trifle stale and insipid.  He was invested with a
loose-fitting cosmopolitan Occidentalism, which seemed to say
to Roger that, of the two, he was the provincial.
Considering his years,—they numbered but twenty-five,—Fenton’s
tough maturity was very wonderful.  You would
have confessed, however, that he had a true genius for his
part, and that it became him better to play at manhood
than at juvenility.  He could never have been a ruddy-checked
boy.  He was tall and lean, with a keen dark eye,
a smile humorous, but not exactly genial, a thin,
drawling, almost feminine voice, and a strange Southwestern
accent.  His voice, at first, might have given you certain
presumptuous hopes as to a soft spot in his stiff young
hide; but after listening awhile to its colorless monotone,
you would have felt, I think, that though it was an
instrument of one string, that solitary chord was not likely
to become relaxed.  Fenton was furthermore flat-chested
and high-shouldered, though he was evidently very strong.
His straight black hair was always carefully combed, and
a small diamond pin adorned the bosom of his shirt.  His
feet were small and slender, and his left hand was
decorated with a neat specimen of tattooing.  You never would
have called him modest, yet you would hardly have called
him impudent; for he had evidently lived with people
who had not analyzed appreciation to this fine point.  He
had nothing whatever of the manner of society, but it was
surprising how gracefully a certain shrewd <i>bonhomie</i> and
smart good-humor enabled him to dispense with it.  He
stood with his hands in his pockets, watching punctilio
take its course, and thinking, probably, what a d——d fool
she was to go so far roundabout to a point he could reach
with a single shuffle of his long legs.  Roger, from the
first hour of his being in the house, felt pledged to dislike
him.  Fenton patronized him; he made him feel like a small
boy, like an old woman; he sapped the roots of the poor
fellow’s comfortable consciousness of being a man of the
world.  Fenton was a man of twenty worlds.  He had
knocked about and dabbled in affairs and adventures since
he was ten years old; he knew the American continent
as he knew the palm of his hand; he was redolent of
enterprise, of “operations,” of a certain fierce friction
with mankind.  Roger would have liked to believe that
he doubted his word, that there was a chance of his not
being Nora’s cousin, but a youth of an ardent swindling
genius who had come into possession of a parcel of facts
too provokingly pertinent to be wasted.  He had
evidently known the late Mr. Lambert,—the poor man must
have had plenty of such friends; but was he, in truth, his
wife’s nephew?  Had not this shadowy nepotism been
excogitated over an unpaid hotel bill?  So Roger
fretfully meditated, but generally with no great gain of
ground.  He inclined, on the whole, to believe the young
man’s pretensions were valid, and to reserve his pugnacity
for the use he might possibly make of them.  Of course
Fenton had not come down to spend a stupid week in the
country out of cousinly affection.  Nora was but the
means; Roger’s presumptive wealth and bounty were the
end.  “He comes to make love to his cousin, and marry
her if he can.  I, who have done so much, will of course
do more; settle an income directly on the bride, make my
will in her favor, and die at my earliest convenience!
How furious he must be,” Roger continued to meditate,
“to find me so young and hearty!  How furious he would
be if he knew a little more!”  This line of argument was
justified in a manner by the frankness of Fenton’s
intimation that he was incapable of any other relation to a
fact than a desire to turn it to pecuniary account.  Roger
was uneasy, yet he took a certain comfort in the belief
that, thanks to his early lessons, Nora could be trusted
to confine her cousin to the limits of cousinship.  In
whatever he might have failed, he had certainly taught
her to know a gentleman.  Cousins are born, not made;
but lovers may be accepted at discretion.  Nora’s
discretion, surely, would not be wanting.  I may add also that,
in his desire to order all things well, Roger caught
himself wondering whether, at the worst, a little precursory
love-making would do any harm.  The ground might be
gently tickled to receive his own sowing; the petals of
the young girl’s nature, playfully forced apart, would
leave the golden heart of the flower but the more
accessible to his own vertical rays.
</p>

<p>
It was cousinship for Nora, certainly; but cousinship
was much; more than Roger fancied, luckily for his peace
of mind.  To a girl who had never had anything to boast
of, this late-coming kinsman seemed a sort of godsend.
Nora was so proud of turning out to have a cousin as
well as other people, that she treated Fenton much better
than other people treat their cousins.  It must be said
that Fenton was not altogether unworthy of her favors.
He meant no especial harm to his fellow-men save in so
far as he meant uncompromising benefit to himself.  The
Knight of La Mancha, on the torrid flats of Spain, never
urged his gaunt steed with a grimmer pressure of the
knees than that with which Fenton held himself erect on
the hungry hobby of success.  Shrewd as he was, he had
perhaps, as well, a ray of Don Quixote’s divine obliquity
of vision.  It is at least true that success as yet had been
painfully elusive, and a part of the peril to Nora’s girlish
heart lay in this melancholy grace of undeserved failure.
The young man’s imagination was eager; he had a generous
need of keeping too many irons on the fire.  His
invention was feeling rather jaded when he made overtures
to Roger.  He had learned six months before of his
cousin’s situation, and had felt no great sentimental need
of making her acquaintance; but at last, revolving many
things of a certain sort, he had come to wonder whether
these lucky mortals could not be induced to play into his
hands.  Roger’s wealth (which he largely overestimated)
and Roger’s obvious taste for sharing it with other
people, Nora’s innocence and Nora’s prospects,—it would
surely take a great fool not to pluck the rose from so
thornless a tree.  He foresaw these good things melting
and trickling into the empty channel of his own fortune.
Exactly what use he meant to make of Nora he would
have been at a loss to say.  Plain matrimony might or
might not be a prize.  At any rate, it could do a clever
man no harm to have a rich girl foolishly in love with
him.  He turned, therefore, upon his charming cousin the
softer side of his genius.  He very soon began to see that
he had never known so delightful a person, and indeed
his growing sense of her sweetness bade fair to make him
bungle his dishonesty.  She was altogether sweet enough
to be valued for herself.  She represented something that
he had never yet encountered.  Nora was a young lady;
how she had come to it was one of the outer mysteries;
but there she was, consummate!  He made no point of a
man being a gentleman; in fact, when a man was a
gentleman you had rather to be one yourself, which didn’t
pay; but for a woman to be a lady was plainly pure gain.
He had wit enough to detect something extremely grateful
in Nora’s half-concessions, her reserve of freshness.
Women, to him, had seemed mostly as cut flowers, blooming
awhile in the waters of occasion, but yielding no
second or rarer satisfaction.  Nora was expanding in the
sunshine of her cousin’s gallantry.  She had known so
few young men that she had not learned to be fastidious,
and Fenton represented to her fancy that great collective
manhood from which Roger was excluded by his very
virtues.  He had an irresistible air of action, alertness,
and purpose.  Poor Roger held one much less in suspense.
She regarded her cousin with something of the
thrilled attention which one bestows on the naked arrow,
poised across the bow.  He had, moreover, the inestimable
merit of representing her own side of her situation.  He
very soon became sensible of this merit, and you may be
sure he entertained her to the top of her bent.  He
gossiped by the hour about her father, and gave her very
plainly to understand that poor Mr. Lambert had been
more sinned against than sinning.
</p>

<p>
Nora was not slow to perceive that Roger had no love
for their guest, and she immediately conceded him his
right of judgment, thinking it natural that they should
quarrel about her a little.  Fenton’s presence was a tacit
infringement of Roger’s prescriptive right of property.
If her cousin had only never come!  This might have
been, though she could not bring herself to wish it.  Nora
felt vaguely that here was a chance for tact, for the
woman’s peace-making art.  To keep Roger in spirits,
she put on a dozen unwonted graces; she waited on him,
appealed to him, smiled at him with unwearied iteration.
But the main effect of these sweet offices was to make her
cousin think her the prettier.  Roger’s rancorous
suspicion transmuted to bitterness what would otherwise
have been pure delight.  She was turning hypocrite; she
was throwing dust in his eyes; she was plotting with that
vulgar Missourian.  Fenton, of course, was forced to
admit that he had reckoned without his host.  Roger had
had the impudence not to turn out a simpleton; he was
not a shepherd of the golden age; he was a dogged
modern, with prosy prejudices; the wind of his favor blew
as it listed.  Fenton took the liberty of being extremely
irritated at the other’s want of ductility.  “Hang the
man!” he said to himself, “why can’t he trust me?
What is he afraid of?  Why don’t he take me as a friend
rather than an enemy?  Let him be frank, and I will be
frank.  I could put him up to several things.  And what
does he want to do with Nora, any way?”  This latter
question Fenton came very soon to answer, and the answer
amused him not a little.  It seemed to him an extremely
odd use of one’s time and capital, this fashioning of a
wife to order.  There was a long-winded patience about
it, an arrogance of leisure, which excited his ire.  Roger
might surely have found his fit ready made!  His
disappointment, a certain angry impulse to break a window, as
it were, in Roger’s hothouse, the sense finally that what
he should gain he would gain from Nora alone, though
indeed she was too confoundedly innocent to appreciate
his pressing necessities,—these things combined to heat
the young man’s humor to the fever-point, and to make
him strike more random blows than belonged to plain
prudence.
</p>

<p>
The autumn being well advanced, the warmth of the
sun had become very grateful.  Nora used to spend much
of the morning in strolling about the dismantled garden
with her cousin.  Roger would stand at the window with
his honest face more nearly disfigured by a scowl than
ever before.  It was the old, old story, to his mind:
nothing succeeds with women like just too little
deference.  Fenton would lounge along by Nora’s side, with
his hands in his pockets, a cigar in his mouth, his shoulders
raised to his ears, and a pair of tattered slippers on
his absurdly diminutive feet.  Not only had Nora
forgiven him this last breach of decency, but she had
forthwith begun to work him a new pair of slippers.  “What
on earth,” thought Roger, “do they find to talk about?”  Their
conversation, meanwhile, ran in some such strain
as this.
</p>

<p>
“My dear Nora,” said the young man, “what on
earth, week in and week out, do you and Mr. Lawrence
find to talk about?”
</p>

<p>
“A great many things, George.  We have lived long
enough together to have a great many subjects of
conversation.”
</p>

<p>
“It was a most extraordinary thing, his adopting you,
if you don’t mind my saying so.  Imagine my adopting
a little girl.”
</p>

<p>
“You and Roger are very different men.”
</p>

<p>
“We certainly are.  What in the world did he expect
to do with you?”
</p>

<p>
“Very much what he has done, I suppose.  He has
educated me, he has made me what I am.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re a very nice little person; but, upon my
word, I don’t see that he’s to thank for it.  A lovely
girl can be neither made nor marred.”
</p>

<p>
“Possibly!  But I give you notice that I am not a
lovely girl.  I have it in me to be, under provocation,
anything but a lovely girl.  I owe everything to Roger.
You must say nothing against him.  I will not allow it.
What would have become of me—”  She stopped,
betrayed by her glance and voice.
</p>

<p>
“Mr. Lawrence is a model of all the virtues, I admit!
But, Nora, I confess I am jealous of him.  Does he
expect to educate you forever?  You seem to me to have
already all the learning a pretty woman needs.  What
does he know about women?  What does he expect to
do with you two or three years hence?  Two or three
years hence you will be number one.”  And Fenton
began to whistle with vehement gayety, executing with
shuffling feet a momentary fandango.  “Two or three
years hence, when you look in the glass, remember I said
so!”
</p>

<p>
“He means to go to Europe one of these days,” said
Nora, irrelevantly.
</p>

<p>
“One of these days!  One would think he expects to
keep you forever.  Not if I can help it.  And why
Europe, in the name of all that’s patriotic?  Europe be
hanged!  You ought to come out to your own section of
the country, and see your own people.  I can introduce
you to the best society in St. Louis.  I’ll tell you what,
my dear.  You don’t know it, but you’re a regular
Western girl.”
</p>

<p>
A certain foolish gladness in being the creature thus
denominated prompted Nora to a gush of momentary
laughter, of which Roger, within the window, caught
the soundless ripple.  “You ought to know, George,”
she said, “you are Western enough yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I am.  I glory in it.  It’s the only place
for a man of ideas!  In the West you can do something!
Round here you’re all stuck fast in ten feet of varnish.
For yourself, Nora, at bottom you’re all right; but
superficially you’re just a trifle overstarched.  But we’ll take
it out of you!  It comes of living with a stiff-necked—”
</p>

<p>
Nora bent for a moment her lustrous eyes on the
young man, as if to recall him to order.  “I beg you to
understand, once for all,” she said, “that I refuse to
listen to disrespectful allusions to Roger.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll say it again, just to make you look at me so.
If I ever fall in love with you, it will be when you are
scolding me.  All I have got to do is to attack your
papa—”
</p>

<p>
“He is not my papa.  I have had one papa; that’s
enough.  I say it in all respect.”
</p>

<p>
“If he is not your papa, what is he?  He is a dog in
the manger.  He must be either one thing or the other.
When you are very little older, you will understand
that.”
</p>

<p>
“He may be whatever thing you please.  I shall be
but one,—his best friend.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton laughed with a kind of fierce hilarity.  “You
are so innocent, my dear, that one doesn’t know where
to take you.  Do you expect to marry him?”
</p>

<p>
Nora stopped in the path, with her eyes on her cousin.
For a moment he was half confounded by their startled
severity and the flush of pain in her cheek.  “Marry
Roger!” she said, with great gravity.
</p>

<p>
“Why, he’s a man, after all!”
</p>

<p>
Nora was silent a moment; and then with a certain
forced levity, walking on: “I had better wait till I am
asked.”
</p>

<p>
“He will ask you!  You will see.”
</p>

<p>
“If he does, I shall be surprised.”
</p>

<p>
“You will pretend to be.  Women always do.”
</p>

<p>
“He has known me as a child,” she continued, heedless
of his sarcasm.  “I shall always be a child, for
him.”
</p>

<p>
“He will like that,” said Fenton.  “He will like a
child of twenty.”
</p>

<p>
Nora, for an instant was lost in meditation.  “As
regards marriage,” she said at last, quietly, “I will do
what Roger wishes.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton lost patience.  “Roger be hanged!” he cried.
“You are not his slave.  You must choose for yourself
and act for yourself.  You must obey your own heart.
You don’t know what you are talking about.  One of
these days your heart will say its say.  Then we shall see
what becomes of Roger’s wishes!  If he wants to make
what he pleases of you, he should have taken you
younger,—or older!  Don’t tell me seriously that you
can ever love (don’t play upon words: love, I mean, in
the one sense that means anything!) such a solemn little
fop as that!  Don’t protest, my dear girl; I must have
my say.  I speak in your own interest; I speak, at any
rate, from my own heart.  I detest the man.  I came
here perfectly on the square, and he has treated me as if
I weren’t fit to touch with tongs.  I am poor, I have
my way to make, I ain’t fashionable; but I’m an honest
man, for all that, and as good as he, take me altogether.
Why can’t he show me a moment’s frankness?  Why
can’t he take me by the hand, and say, ‘Come, young
man, I’ve got capital, and you’ve got brains; let’s pull
together a stroke?’  Does he think I want to steal his
spoons or pick his pocket?  Is that hospitality?  It’s a
poor kind.”
</p>

<p>
This passionate outbreak, prompted in about equal
measure by baffled ambition and wounded conceit, made
sad havoc with Nora’s loyalty to her friend.  Her sense
of natural property in her cousin,—the instinct of free
affection alternating more gratefully than she knew with
the dim consciousness of measured dependence,—had
become in her heart a sort of sweet excitement.  It made
her feel that Roger’s mistrust was cruel; it was doubly
cruel that George should feel it.  Two angry men, at
any rate, were quarrelling about her, and she must avert
an explosion.  She promised herself to dismiss Fenton
the next day.  Of course, by the very fact of this
concession, Roger lost ground with her, and George acquired
the grace of the persecuted.  Meanwhile, Roger’s jealous
irritation came to a head.  On the evening following the
little scene I have narrated the young couple sat by the
fire in the library; Fenton on a stool at his cousin’s feet
holding, while Nora wound them on reels, the wools
which were to be applied to the manufacture of those
invidious slippers.  Roger, after grimly watching their
mutual amenities for some time over the cover of a book,
unable to master his fierce discomposure, departed with a
telltale stride.  They heard him afterwards walking up
and down the piazza, where he was appealing from his
troubled nerves to the ordered quietude of the stars.
</p>

<p>
“He hates me so,” said Fenton, “that I believe if I
were to go out there he would draw a knife.”
</p>

<p>
“O George!” cried Nora, horrified.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a fact, my dear.  I am afraid you’ll have to
give me up.  I wish I had never seen you!”
</p>

<p>
“At all events, we can write to each other.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s writing?  I don’t know how to write!  I
will, though!  I suppose he will open my letters.  So
much the worse for him!”
</p>

<p>
Nora, as she wound her wool, mused intently.  “I
can’t believe he really grudges me our friendship.  It
must be something else.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton, with a clench of his fist, arrested suddenly the
outflow of the skein from his hand.  “It is something
else,” he said.  “It’s our possible—more than
friendship!”  And he grasped her two hands in his own.
“Nora, choose!  Between me and him!”
</p>

<p>
She stared a moment; then her eyes filled with tears.
“O George,” she cried, “you make me very unhappy.”  She
must certainly tell him to go; and yet that very
movement of his which had made it doubly needful made
it doubly hard.  “I will talk to Roger,” she said.  “No
one should be condemned unheard.  We may all
misunderstand each other.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton, half an hour later, having, as he said, letters
to write, went up to his own room; shortly after which,
Roger returned to the library.  Half an hour’s communion
with the starlight and the ringing crickets had
drawn the sting from his irritation.  There came to him,
too, a mortifying sense of his guest having outdone him
in civility.  This would never do.  He took refuge in
imperturbable good-humor, and entered the room in high
indifference.  But even before he had spoken, something
in Nora’s face caused this wholesome dose of
resignation to stick in his throat.  “Your cousin is gone?” he
said.
</p>

<p>
“To his own room.  He has some letters to write.”
</p>

<p>
“Shall I hold your wools?” Roger asked, after a
pause.
</p>

<p>
“Thank you.  They are all wound.”
</p>

<p>
“For whom are your slippers?”  He knew, of course;
but the question came.
</p>

<p>
“For George.  Did I not tell you?  Do you think
them pretty?”  And she held up her work.
</p>

<p>
“Prettier than he deserves.”
</p>

<p>
Nora gave him a rapid glance and miscounted her
stitch.  “You don’t like poor George,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No.  Since you ask me, I don’t like poor George.”
</p>

<p>
Nora was silent.  At last: “Well!” she said, “you’ve
not the same reasons as I have.”
</p>

<p>
“So I am bound to believe!  You must have excellent
reasons.”
</p>

<p>
“Excellent.  He is my own, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“Your own—?  Ah!”  And he gave a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
“My own cousin,” said Nora.
</p>

<p>
“Your own grandfather!” cried Roger.
</p>

<p>
She stopped her work.  “What do you mean?” she
asked gravely.
</p>

<p>
Roger began to blush a little.  “I mean—I mean—that
I don’t believe in your cousin.  He doesn’t satisfy
me.  I don’t like him.  He contradicts himself, his story
doesn’t hang together.  I have nothing but his word.  I
am not bound to take it.”
</p>

<p>
“Roger, Roger,” said Nora, with great softness, “do
you mean that he is an impostor?”
</p>

<p>
“The word is your own.  He’s not an honest man.”
</p>

<p>
She slowly rose from her little bench, gathering her
work into the skirt of her dress.  “And, doubting of his
honesty, you have let him take up his abode here, you
have let him become dear to me?”
</p>

<p>
She was making him ten times a fool!  “Why, if you
liked him,” he said.  “When did I ever refuse you
anything?”
</p>

<p>
There came upon Nora a sudden unpitying sense that
Roger was ridiculous.  “Honest or not honest,” she
said with vehemence, “I do like him.  Cousin or no
cousin, he is my friend.”
</p>

<p>
“Very good.  But I warn you.  I don’t enjoy talking
to you thus.  Only let me tell you, once for all, that
your cousin, your friend—your—whatever he
is!”—  He faltered an instant; Nora’s eyes were fixed on him.
“That he disgusts me!”
</p>

<p>
“You are extremely unjust.  You have taken no trouble
to know him.  You have treated him from the first with
small civility!”
</p>

<p>
“Was the trouble to be all mine?  Civility! he never
missed it; he doesn’t know what it means.”
</p>

<p>
“He knows more than you think.  But we must
talk no more about him.”  She rolled together her
canvas and reels; and then suddenly, with passionate
inconsequence, “Poor, poor George!” she cried.
</p>

<p>
Roger watched her a moment; then he said bitterly,
“You disappoint me.”
</p>

<p>
“You must have formed great hopes of me!” she
answered.
</p>

<p>
“I confess I had.”
</p>

<p>
“Say good by to them then, Roger.  If this is
wrong, I am all wrong!”  She spoke with a proud
decision, which was very becoming; she had never yet
come so near being beautiful.  In the midst of his
passionate vexation Roger admired her.  The scene seemed
for a moment a bad dream, from which, with a start, he
might wake up to tell her he loved her.
</p>

<p>
“Your anger gives an admirable point to your remarks.
Indeed, it gives a beauty to your face.  Must a
young lady be in the wrong to be attractive?” he went
on, hardly knowing what he said.  But a burning blush
in her cheeks recalled him to a kind of self-abhorrence.
“Would to God,” he cried, “your abominable cousin
had never come between us!”
</p>

<p>
“Between us?  He is not between us.  I stand as
near you, Roger, as I ever did.  Of course George will
go away immediately.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course!  I am not so sure.  He will, I suppose,
if he is asked.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I shall ask him.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense.  You will not enjoy that.”
</p>

<p>
“We are old friends by this time,” said Nora, with
terrible irony.  “I shall not in the least mind.”
</p>

<p>
Roger could have choked himself.  He had brought
his case to this: Fenton a martyred proscript, and Nora
a brooding victim of duty.  “Do I want to turn the
man out of the house?” he cried.  “Do me a favor—I
insist upon it.  Say nothing to him, let him stay as
long as he chooses.  I am not afraid!  I don’t trust him,
but I trust you.  I am curious to see how long he will
have the impudence to stay.  A fortnight hence I shall
be justified.  You will say to me, ‘Roger, you were
right.  George is not a gentleman.’  There!  I insist.”
</p>

<p>
“A gentleman?  Really, what are we talking about?
Do you mean that he wears a false diamond in his shirt?
He will take it off if I ask him.  There’s a long way
between wearing false diamonds—”
</p>

<p>
“And stealing real ones!  I don’t know.  I have
always fancied they go together.  At all events, Nora, he
is not to suspect that he has been able to make trouble
between two old friends.”
</p>

<p>
Nora stood for a moment in irresponsive meditation.
“I think he means to go,” she said.  “If you want him
to stay, you must ask him.”  And without further words
she marched out of the room.  Roger followed her with
his eyes.  He thought of Lady Castlewood in “Henry
Esmond,” who looked “devilish handsome in a passion.”
</p>

<p>
Lady Castlewood, meanwhile, ascended to her own
room, flung her work upon the floor, and, dropping into
a chair, betook herself to weeping.  It was late before she
slept.  She awoke with a new consciousness of the
burden of life.  Her own burden certainly was small, but
her strength, as yet, was untested.  She had thought, in
her many reveries, of a possible disagreement with Roger,
and prayed that it might never come by a fault of hers.
The fault was hers now in that she had surely cared less
for duty than for joy.  Roger, indeed, had shown a
pitiful smallness of view.  This was a weakness; but who
was she, to keep account of Roger’s weaknesses?  It
was to a weakness of Roger’s that she owed her food and
raiment and shelter.  It helped to quench her resentment
that she felt, somehow, that, whether Roger smiled
or frowned, George would still be George.  He was not
a gentleman: well and good; neither was she, for that
matter, a lady.  But a certain manful hardness like
George’s would not be amiss in the man one was to love.
</p>

<p>
A simpler soul than Fenton’s might have guessed at
the trouble of this quiet household.  Fenton read in it
as well an omen of needful departure.  He accepted the
necessity with an acute sense of failure,—almost of
injury.  He had gained nothing but the bother of being
loved.  It was a bother, because it gave him an unwonted
sense of responsibility.  It seemed to fling upon all things
a dusky shade of prohibition.  Yet the matter had its
brightness, too, if a man could but swallow his
superstitions.  He cared for Nora quite enough to tell her he
loved her; he had said as much, with an easy conscience,
to girls for whom he cared far less.  He felt gratefully
enough the cool vestment of tenderness which she had
spun about him, like a web of imponderable silver; but
he had other uses for his time than to go masquerading
through Nora’s fancy.  The defeat of his hope that
Roger, like a testy old uncle in a comedy, would shower
blessings and bank-notes upon his union with his cousin,
involved the discomfiture of a secondary project; the
design, namely, of borrowing five thousand dollars.  The
reader will smile; but such is the simplicity of “smart
men.”  He would content himself now with five hundred.
In this collapse of his visions he fell a-musing
upon Nora’s financial value.
</p>

<p>
“Look here,” he said to her, with an air of heroic
effort, “I see I’m in the way.  I must be off.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry, George,” said Nora, sadly.
</p>

<p>
“So am I.  I never supposed I was proud.  But I
reckoned without my host!” he said with a bitter laugh.
“I wish I had never come.  Or rather I don’t.  It is
worth it all to know you.”
</p>

<p>
She began to question him soothingly about his projects
and prospects; and hereupon, for once, Fenton bent
his mettle to simulate a pathetic incapacity.  He set forth
that he was discouraged; the future was a blank.  It
was child’s play, attempting to do anything without
capital.
</p>

<p>
“And you have no capital?” said Nora, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Fenton gave a poignant smile.  “Why, my dear girl,
I’m a poor man!”
</p>

<p>
“How poor?”
</p>

<p>
“Poor, poor, poor.  Poor as a rat.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t mean that you are penniless?”
</p>

<p>
“What is the use of my telling you?  You can’t help
me.  And it would only make you unhappy.”
</p>

<p>
“If you are unhappy, I want to be!”
</p>

<p>
This golden vein of sentiment might certainly be
worked.  Fenton took out his pocket-book, drew from
it four bank-notes of five dollars each, and ranged them
with a sort of mournful playfulness in a line on his knee.
“That’s my fortune.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you mean to say that twenty dollars is all you
have in the world?”
</p>

<p>
Fenton smoothed out the creases, caressingly, in the
soiled and crumpled notes.  “It’s a great shame to bring
you down to a poor man’s secrets,” he said.  “Fortune
has raised you above them.”
</p>

<p>
Nora’s heart began to beat.  “Yes, it has.  I have a
little money, George.  Some eighty dollars.”
</p>

<p>
Eighty dollars!  George suppressed a groan.  “He
keeps you rather low.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, I have very little use for money, and no chance,
here in the country, to spend it.  Roger is extremely
generous.  Every few weeks he makes me take some.  I
often give it away to the poor people hereabouts.  Only
a fortnight ago I refused to take any more on account of
my still having this.  It’s agreed between us that I may
give what I please in charity, and that my charities are
my own affair.  If I had only known of you, George, I
should have appointed you my pensioner-in-chief.”
</p>

<p>
George was silent.  He was wondering intently how
he might arrange to become the standing recipient of
her overflow.  Suddenly he remembered that he ought to
protest.  But Nora had lightly quitted the room.  Fenton
repocketed his twenty dollars and awaited her
reappearance.  Eighty dollars were not a fortune; still they
were eighty dollars.  To his great annoyance, before Nora
returned Roger presented himself.  The young man felt
for an instant as if he had been caught in an act of
sentimental burglary, and made a movement to conciliate his
detector.  “I am afraid I must bid you good by,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Roger frowned, and wondered whether Nora had spoken.
At this moment she reappeared, flushed and out of breath
with the excitement of her purpose.  She had been counting
over her money, and held in each hand a little fluttering
package of bank-notes.  On seeing Roger she stopped
and blushed, exchanging with her cousin a rapid glance
of inquiry.  He almost glared at her, whether with
warning or with menace she hardly knew.  Roger stood
looking at her, half amazed.  Suddenly, as the meaning of
her errand flashed upon him, he turned a furious
crimson.  He made a step forward, but cautioned himself;
then, folding his arms, he silently waited.  Nora, after a
moment’s hesitation, rolling her notes together, came up
to her cousin and held out the little package.  Fenton
kept his hands in his pockets and devoured her with his
eyes.  “What’s all this?” he said brutally.
</p>

<p>
“O George!” cried Nora; and her eyes filled with
tears.
</p>

<p>
Roger had divined the situation; the shabby victimization
of the young girl and her kinsman’s fury at the
disclosure of his avidity.  He was angry; but he was even
more disgusted.  From so vulgar a knave there was little
rivalship to fear.  “I am afraid I am rather a marplot,”
he said.  “Don’t insist, Nora.  Wait till my back
is turned.”
</p>

<p>
“I have nothing to be ashamed of,” said Nora.
</p>

<p>
“You?  O, nothing whatever!” cried Roger with a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Fenton stood leaning against the mantel-piece, desperately
sullen, with a look of vicious confusion.  “It is
only I who have anything to be ashamed of,” he said at
last, bitterly, with an effort.  “My poverty!”
</p>

<p>
Roger smiled graciously.  “Honest poverty is never
shameful!”
</p>

<p>
Fenton gave him an insolent stare.  “Honest poverty!
You know a great deal about it.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t appeal to poor little Nora, man, for her
savings,” Roger went on.  “Come to me.”
</p>

<p>
“You are unjust,” said Nora.  “He didn’t appeal to
me.  I appealed to him.  I guessed his poverty.  He
has only twenty dollars in the world.”
</p>

<p>
“O you poor little fool!” roared Fenton’s eyes.
Roger was delighted.  At a single stroke he might
redeem his incivility and reinstate himself in Nora’s
affections.  He took out his pocket-book.  “Let me help
you.  It was very stupid of me not to have guessed your
embarrassment.”  And he counted out a dozen notes.
</p>

<p>
Nora stepped to her cousin’s side and passed her hand
through his arm.  “Don’t be proud,” she murmured
caressingly.
</p>

<p>
Roger’s notes were new and crisp.  Fenton looked
hard at the opposite wall, but, explain it who can, he read
their successive figures,—a fifty, four twenties, six tens.
He could have howled.
</p>

<p>
“Come, don’t be proud,” repeated Roger, holding out
this little bundle of wealth.
</p>

<p>
Two great passionate tears welled into the young man’s
eyes.  The sight of Roger’s sturdy sleekness, of the
comfortable twinkle of patronage in his eye, was too much
for him.  “I shall not give <i>you</i> a chance to be proud,” he
said.  “Take care!  Your papers may go into the fire.”
</p>

<p>
“O George!” murmured Nora; and her murmur
seemed to him delicious.
</p>

<p>
He bent down his head, passed his arm round her
shoulders, and kissed her on her forehead.  “Good by,
dearest Nora,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Roger stood staring, with his proffered gift.  “You
decline?” he cried, almost defiantly.
</p>

<p>
“‘Decline’ is not the word.  A man does not decline
an insult.”
</p>

<p>
Was Fenton, then, to have the best of it, and was his
own very generosity to be turned against him?  Blindly,
passionately, Roger crumpled the notes into his fist and
tossed them into the fire.  In an instant they began to
blaze.
</p>

<p>
“Roger, are you mad?” cried Nora.  And she made
a movement to rescue the crackling paper.  Fenton burst
into a laugh.  He caught her by the arm, clasped her
round the waist, and forced her to stand and watch the
brief blaze.  Pressed against his side, she felt the quick
beating of his heart.  As the notes disappeared her eyes
sought Roger’s face.  He looked at her stupidly, and then
turning on his heel he walked out of the room.  Her
cousin, still holding her, showered upon her forehead half
a dozen fierce kisses.  But disengaging herself—“You
must leave the house!” she cried.  “Something dreadful
will happen.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton had soon packed his valise, and Nora, meanwhile,
had ordered a vehicle to carry him to the station.
She waited for him in the portico.  When he came out,
with his bag in his hand, she offered him again her little
roll of bills.  But he was a wiser man than half an hour
before.  He took them, turned them over, and selected a
one-dollar note.  “I will keep this,” he said, “in
remembrance, and only spend it for my last dinner.”  She made
him promise, however, that if trouble really overtook him,
he would let her know, and in any case he would write.
As the wagon went over the crest of an adjoining hill he
stood up and waved his hat.  His tall, gaunt young figure,
as it rose dark against the cold November sunset, cast a
cooling shadow across the fount of her virgin sympathies.
Such was the outline, surely, of the conquering hero, not
of the conquered.  Her fancy followed him forth into the
world with a sense of comradeship.

<p>
Roger’s quarrel with his young companion, if
quarrel it was, was never repaired.  It had scattered
its seed; they were left lying, to be absorbed
in the conscious soil or dispersed by some benignant
breeze of accident, as destiny might appoint.  But as a
manner of clearing the air of its thunder, Roger, a week
after Fenton’s departure, proposed she should go with
him for a fortnight to town.  Later, perhaps, they might
arrange to remain for the winter.  Nora had been longing
vaguely for the relief of a change of circumstances;
she assented with great good-will.  They lodged at an
hotel,—not the establishment at which they had made
acquaintance.  Here, late in the afternoon, the day after their
arrival, Nora sat by the window, waiting for Roger to come
and take her to dinner, and watching with the intentness of
country eyes the hurrying throng in the street; thinking
too at moments of a certain blue bonnet she had bought
that morning, and comparing it, not uncomplacently, with
the transitory bonnets on the pavement.  A gentleman
was introduced; Nora had not forgotten Hubert Lawrence.
Hubert had occupied for more than a year past
a pastoral office in the West, and had recently had little
communication with his cousin.  Nora he had seen but
on a single occasion, that of his visit to Roger, six
months after her advent.  She had grown in the interval,
from the little girl who slept with the “Child’s Own
Book” under her pillow and dreamed of the Prince
Avenant, into a lofty maiden who reperused the “Heir
of Redcliffe,” and mused upon the loves of the clergy.
Hubert; too, had changed in his own degree.  He was
now thirty-one years of age, and his character had lost
something of a certain boyish vagueness of outline, which
formerly had not been without its grace.  But his elder
grace was scarcely less effective.  Various possible
half-shadows in his personality had melted into broad, shallow
lights.  He was now, distinctly, one of the light-armed
troops of the army of the Lord.  He fought the Devil as
an irresponsible skirmisher, not as a sturdy gunsman
planted beside a booming sixty-pounder.  The clerical
cloth, as Hubert wore it, was not unmitigated sable; and
in spite of his cloth, such as it was, humanity rather
than divinity got the lion’s share of his attentions.  He
loved doubtless, in this world, the heavenward face of
things, but he loved, as regards heaven, the earthward.
He was rather an idler in the walks of theology, and he was
uncommitted to any very rigid convictions.  He thought
the old theological positions in very bad taste, but he
thought the new theological negations in no taste at all.
In fact, Hubert believed so vaguely and languidly in the
Devil that there was but slender logic in his having
undertaken the cure of souls.  He administered his spiritual
medicines in homoeopathic doses.  It had been maliciously
said that he had turned parson because parsons
enjoy peculiar advantages in approaching the fair sex.
The presumption is in their favor.  Our business,
however, is not to pick up idle reports.  Hubert was, on the
whole, a decidedly light weight, and yet his want of
spiritual passion was by no means, in effect, a want of
motive or stimulus; for the central pivot of his being
continued to operate with the most noiseless precision
and regularity,—the slim, erect, inflexible <i>Ego</i>.  To the
eyes of men, and especially to the eyes of women,
whatever may have been the moving cause, the outer
manifestation was very agreeable.  If Hubert had no great
firmness of faith, he had a very pretty firmness of
manner.  He was gentle without timidity, frank without
arrogance, clever without pedantry.  The common measure
of clerical disallowance was reduced in his hands to the
tacit protest of a generous personal purity.  His appearance
bore various wholesome traces of the practical lessons
of his Western pastorate.  This had not been to his
taste; he had had to apply himself, to devote himself, to
compromise with a hundred aversions.  His talents had
been worth less to him than he expected, and he had been
obliged, as the French say, to <i>payer de sa personne</i>,—that
person for which he entertained so delicate a respect.  All
this had given him a slightly jaded, overwearied look,
certain to deepen his interest in feminine eyes.  He had
actually a couple of fine wrinkles in his seraphic forehead.
He secretly rejoiced in his wrinkles.  They were his crown
of glory.  He had suffered, he had worked, he had been
bored.  Now he believed in earthly compensations.
</p>

<p>
“Dear me!” he said, “can this be Nora Lambert?”
</p>

<p>
She had risen to meet him, and held out her hand with
girlish frankness.  She was dressed in a light, silk dress;
she seemed a young woman grown.  “I have been growing
hard in all these years,” she said.  “I have had to
catch up with those <i>pieds énormes</i>.”  The readers will not
have forgotten that Hubert had thus qualified her lower
members.  Ignorant as she was, at the moment, of the
French tongue, her memory had instinctively retained
the words, and she had taken an early opportunity to
look out <i>pied</i> in the dictionary.  <i>Énorme</i>, of course, spoke
for itself.
</p>

<p>
“You must have caught up with them now,” Hubert
said, laughing.  “You are an enormous young lady.
I should never have known you.”  He sat down, asked
various questions about Roger, and adjured her to tell
him, as he said, “all about herself.”  The invitation was
flattering, but it met only a partial compliance.
Unconscious as yet of her own charm, Nora was oppressed by
a secret admiration of her companion, whose presence
seemed to open a brilliant vista.  She compared him with
her cousin, and wondered that he should be at once so
impressive and so different.  She blushed a little,
privately, for Fenton, and was not ill pleased to think he was
absent.  In the light of Hubert’s good manners, his
admission that he was no gentleman acquired an excessive
force.  By this thrilling intimation of the diversity of the
male sex, the mental pinafore of childhood seemed finally
dismissed.  Hubert was so frank and friendly, so
tenderly and gallantly patronizing, that more than once she
felt herself beginning to expand; but then, suddenly,
something absent in the tone of his assent, a vague fancy
that, in the gathering dusk, he was looking at her all at
his ease, rather than listening to her, converted her
bravery into what she knew to be deplorable little-girlishness.
On the whole, this interview may have passed for
Nora’s first lesson in the art, indispensable to a young
lady on the threshold of society, of talking for half an
hour without saying anything.  The lesson was interrupted
by the arrival of Roger, who greeted his cousin
with almost extravagant warmth, and insisted upon his
staying to dinner.  Roger was to take Nora after dinner
to a concert, for which he felt no great enthusiasm; he
proposed to Hubert, who was a musical man, to occupy
his place.  Hubert demurred awhile; but in the meantime
Nora, having gone to prepare herself, reappeared,
looking extremely well in the blue crape bonnet before
mentioned, with her face bright with anticipated pleasure.
For a moment Roger was vexed at having resigned his
office; Hubert immediately stepped into it.  They came
home late, the blue bonnet nothing the worse for wear,
and the young girl’s face lighted up by her impressions.
Her animation was extreme; she treated Roger to a
representation of the concert, and made a great show of
voice.  Her departing childishness, her dawning tact,
her freedom with Roger, her half-freedom with Hubert,
made a charming mixture, and insured for her auditors
the success of the entertainment.  When she had retired,
amid a mimic storm of applause from the two gentlemen,
Roger solemnly addressed his cousin.  “Well, what do
you think of her?  I hope you have no fault to find with
her feet.”
</p>

<p>
“I have had no observation of her feet,” said Hubert;
“but she will have very handsome hands.  She is a very
nice creature.”  Roger sat lounging in his chair with his
hands in his pockets, his chin on his breast, and a heavy
gaze fixed on Hubert.  The latter was struck with his
deeply preoccupied aspect.  “But let us talk of you rather
than of Nora,” he said.  “I have been waiting for a
chance to tell you that you look very poorly.”
</p>

<p>
“Nora or I,—it’s all one.  She is the only thing in
life I care for.”
</p>

<p>
Hubert was startled by the sombre energy of his tone.
The old polished, placid Roger was in abeyance.  “My
dear fellow,” he said, “you are altogether wrong.  Live
for yourself.  You may be sure she will do as much.  You
take it too hard.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I take it too hard.  It troubles me.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter?  Is she a naughty child?  Is
she more than you bargained for?”  Roger sat gazing
at him in silence, with the same grave eye.  He began to
suspect Nora had turned out a losing investment.  “Has
she—a—low tastes?” he went on.  “Surely not with
that sweet face!”
</p>

<p>
Roger started to his feet impatiently.  “Don’t
misunderstand me!” he cried.  “I have been longing to see
some one,—to talk,—to get some advice,—some
sympathy.  I am fretting myself away.”
</p>

<p>
“Good heavens, man, give her a thousand dollars and
send her back to her family.  You have educated her.”
</p>

<p>
“Her family!  She has no family!  She’s the loneliest
as well as the sweetest, wisest, best of creatures!  If
she were only a tenth as good, I should be a happier man.
I can’t think of parting with her; not for all I possess.”
</p>

<p>
Hubert stared a moment.  “Why, you are in love.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Roger, blushing.  “I am in love.”
</p>

<p>
“Dear me!” murmured Hubert.
</p>

<p>
“I am not ashamed of it,” rejoined Roger, softly.
</p>

<p>
It was no business of Hubert’s, certainly; but he felt
the least bit disappointed.  “Well,” he said coolly, “why
don’t you marry her?”
</p>

<p>
“It is not so simple as that!”
</p>

<p>
“She will not have you?”
</p>

<p>
Roger frowned impatiently.  “Reflect a moment.  You
pretend to be a man of delicacy.”
</p>

<p>
“You mean she is too young?  Nonsense.  If you are
sure of her, the younger the better.”
</p>

<p>
“For my unutterable misery,” said Roger, “I have a
conscience.  I wish to leave her free and take the risk.
I wish to be just and let the matter work itself out.
You may think me absurd, but I wish to be loved for
myself, as other men are loved.”
</p>

<p>
It was a specialty of Hubert’s that in proportion as
other people grew hot, he grew cool.  To keep cool,
morally, in a heated medium was, in fact, for Hubert a
peculiar satisfaction.  He broke into a long light laugh.
“Excuse me,” he said, “but there is something ludicrous
in your attitude.  What business has a lover with a
conscience?  None at all!  That’s why I keep out of it.
It seems to me your prerogative to be downright.  If you
waste any more time in hair-splitting, you will find your
young lady has taken things in the lump!”
</p>

<p>
“Do you really think there is danger?” Roger demanded,
pitifully.  “Not yet awhile.  She’s only a child.
Tell me, rather, is she only a child?  You have spent the
evening beside her: how does she strike a stranger?”
</p>

<p>
While Hubert’s answer lingered on his lips, the door
opened and Nora came in.  Her errand was to demand
the use of Roger’s watch-key, her own having mysteriously
vanished.  She had begun to take out her pins and
had muffled herself for this excursion in a merino
dressing-gown of sombre blue.  Her hair was gathered for the
night into a single massive coil, which had been loosened
by the rapidity of her flight along the passage.  Roger’s
key proved a complete misfit, so that she had recourse to
Hubert’s.  It hung on the watch-chain which depended
from his waistcoat, and some rather intimate fumbling
was needed to adjust it to Nora’s diminutive timepiece.
It worked admirably, and she stood looking at him with
a little smile of caution as it creaked on the pivot.  “I
would not have troubled you,” she said, “but that
without my watch I should oversleep myself.  You know
Roger’s temper, and what I should suffer if I were late
for breakfast!”
</p>

<p>
Roger was ravished at this humorous sally, and when,
on making her escape, she clasped one hand to her head
to support her released tresses, and hurried along the
corridor with the other confining the skirts of her inflated
robe, he kissed his hand after her with more than jocular
good-will.
</p>

<p>
“Ah! it’s as bad as that!” said Hubert, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
“I had no idea she had such hair,” murmured Roger.
“You are right, it is no case for shilly-shallying.”
</p>

<p>
“Take care!” said Hubert.  “She is only a child.”
</p>

<p>
Roger looked at him a moment.  “My dear fellow,
you are a hypocrite.”
</p>

<p>
Hubert colored the least bit, and then took up his hat
and began to smooth it with his handkerchief.  “Not at
all.  See how frank I can be.  I recommend you to marry
the young lady and have done with it.  If you wait, it
will be at your own risk.  I assure you I think she is
charming, and if I am not mistaken, this is only a hint of
future possibilities.  Don’t sow for others to reap.  If
you think the harvest is not ripe, let it ripen in milder
sunbeams than these vigorous hand-kisses.  Lodge her
with some proper person and go to Europe; come home
from Paris a year hence with her trousseau in your trunks,
and I will perform the ceremony without another fee than
the prospect of having an adorable cousin.”  With these
words Hubert left his companion pensive.
</p>

<p>
His words reverberated in Roger’s mind; I may almost
say that they rankled.  A couple of days later, in the
hope of tenderer counsel, he called upon our friend
Mrs. Keith.  This lady had completely rounded the cape of
matrimony, and was now buoyantly at anchor in the placid
cove of well-dowered widowhood.  You have heard many
a young unmarried lady exclaim with a bold sweep of
conception, “Ah me!  I wish I were a widow!”  Mrs. Keith
was precisely the widow that young unmarried
ladies wish to be.  With her diamonds in her dressing-case
and her carriage in her stable, and without a feather’s
weight of encumbrance, she offered a finished example
of satisfied ambition.  Her wants had been definite; these
once gratified, she had not presumed further.  She was a
very much worthier woman than in those hungry virginal
days when Roger had wooed her.  Prosperity had agreed
equally well with her beauty and her temper.  The
wrinkles on her brow had stood still, like Joshua’s sun, and a
host of good intentions and fair promises seemed to
illuminate her person.  Roger, as he stood before her, not
only felt that his passion was incurably defunct, but
allowed himself to doubt that this <i>veuve consolée</i> would
have made an ideal wife.  The lady, mistaking his
embarrassment for the fumes of smouldering ardor,
determined to transmute his devotion by the subtle chemistry
of friendship.  This she found easy work; in ten minutes
the echoes of the past were hushed in the small-talk of
the present.  Mrs. Keith was on the point of sailing for
Europe, and had much to say of her plans and
arrangements,—of the miserable rent she was to get for her
house.  “Why shouldn’t one turn an honest penny?”
she asked.  “And now,” she went on, when the field had
been cleared, “tell me about the young lady.”  This
was precisely what Roger wished; but just as he was
about to begin his story there came an irruption of visitors,
fatal to the confidential.  Mrs. Keith found means to take
him aside.  “Seeing is better than hearing,” she said,
“and I am dying to see her.  Bring her this evening to
dinner, and we shall have her to ourselves.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith had long been for Nora an object of mystical
veneration.  Roger had been in the habit of alluding
to her, not freely nor frequently, but with a certain
implicit consideration which more than once had set Nora
wondering.  She entered the lady’s drawing-room that
evening with an oppressive desire to please.  The
interest manifested by Roger in the question of what she
should wear assured her that he had staked a nameless
something on the impression she might make.  She was
not only reassured, however, but altogether captivated,
by the lavish cordiality of her hostess.  Mrs. Keith kissed
her on both cheeks, held her at her two arms’ length,
gave a twist to the fall of her sash, and made her feel
very plainly that she was being inspected and appraised.
All this was done, however, with a certain flattering light
in the eye and a tender matronly smile which rather
increased than diminished the young girl’s composure.
Mrs. Keith was herself so elegant, so finished, so
fragrant of taste and sense, that before an hour was over
Nora felt that she had borrowed the hint of a dozen
indispensable graces.  After dinner her hostess bade her
sit down to the piano.  Here, feeling sure of her ground,
Nora surpassed herself.  Mrs. Keith beckoned to Roger
to come and sit beside her on the sofa, where, as she
nodded time to the music with her head, she softly conversed.
Prosperity, as I have intimated, had acted on her moral
nature very much as a medicinal tonic—quinine or
iron—acts upon the physical.  She was in a comfortable
glow of charity.  She itched gently, she hardly knew
where,—was it in heart or brain?—to render some
one a service.  She had on hand a small capital of
sentimental patronage for which she desired a secure
investment.  Here was her chance.  The project which Roger
had imparted to her three years before seemed to her,
now she had taken Nora’s measure, to contain such
pretty elements of success that she deemed it a sovereign
pity it should not be rounded into symmetry.  She
determined to lend an artistic hand.  “Does she know it,
that matter?” she asked in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
“I have never told her.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s right.  I approve your delicacy.  Of course
you are sure of your case.  She is altogether lovely,—she
is one in a thousand.  I really envy you; upon my
word, Mr. Lawrence, I am jealous.  She has a style of
her own.  It is not quite beauty; it is not quite
cleverness.  It belongs neither altogether to her person, nor
yet to her mind.  It’s a kind of way she has.  It’s a
way that may lead her far.  She has pretty things, too;
one of these days she may take it into her head to be a
beauty of beauties.  Nature never meant her to hold up
her head so well for nothing.  Ah, how wrinkled and
faded it makes one feel!  To be sixteen years old, with
that head of hair, with health and good connections, with
that amount of good-will at the piano, it’s the very best
thing in the world, if they but knew it!  But no! they
must leave it all behind them; they must pull their hair
to pieces; they must get rid of their complexions; they
must be twenty; they must have lovers, and go their
own gait.  Well, since it must come, we must attend to
the profits: they will take care of the pleasures.  Give
Nora to me for a year.  She needs a woman, a wise
woman, a woman like me.  Men, when they undertake
to meddle with a young girl’s education, are veriest old
grandmothers.  Let me take her to Europe and bring
her out in Rome.  Don’t be afraid; I will guard your
interests.  I will bring you back the most charming girl
in America.  I see her from here!”  And describing a
great curve in the air with her fan, Mrs. Keith inclined
her head to one side in a manner suggestive of a milliner
who descries in the bosom of futurity the ideal bonnet.
Looking at Roger, she saw that her point was gained;
and Nora, having just finished her piece, was accordingly
summoned to the sofa and made to sit down at Mrs. Keith’s
feet.  Roger went and stood before the fire.
“My dear Nora,” said Mrs. Keith, as if she had known
her from childhood, “how should you like to go with me
to Rome?”
</p>

<p>
Nora started to her feet, and stood looking open-eyed
from one to the other.  “Really?” she said.  “Does
Roger—”
</p>

<p>
“Roger,” said Mrs. Keith, “finds you so hard to
manage that he has made you over to me.  I forewarn
you, I am a terrible woman.  But if you are not afraid,
I shall scold you and pinch you no harder than I would
a daughter of my own.”
</p>

<p>
“I give you up for a year,” said Roger.  “It is hard,
troublesome as you are.”
</p>

<p>
Nora stood wavering for a moment, hesitating where
to deposit her excess of joy.  Then graciously dropping
on her knees before Mrs. Keith, she bent her young head
and got rid of it in an ample kiss.  “I am not afraid of
you,” she said simply.  Roger turned round and began
to poke the fire.
</p>

<p>
The next day Nora went forth to buy certain articles
necessary in travelling.  It was raining so heavily that,
at Roger’s direction, she took a carriage.  Coming out
of a shop, in the course of her expedition, she
encountered Hubert Lawrence tramping along in the wet.  He
helped her back to her carriage, and stood for a moment
talking to her through the window.  As they were going
in the same direction, she invited him to get in; and on
his hesitating, she added that she hoped their interview
was not to end there, as she was going to Europe with
Mrs. Keith.  At this news Hubert jumped in and placed
himself on the front seat.  The knowledge that she was
drifting away gave a sudden value to the present occasion.
Add to this that in the light of Roger’s revelation
after the concert, this passive, predestined figure of hers
had acquired for the young man a certain picturesque
interest.  Nora found herself strangely at ease with her
companion.  From time to time she strove to check her
happy freedom: but Hubert evidently, with his superior
urbanity, was not the person to note a little more or less
in a school-girl’s primness.  Her enjoyment of his
presence, her elation in the prospect of departure, made her
gayety reckless.  They went together to half a dozen
shops and talked and laughed so distractedly over her
purchases, that she made them sadly at haphazard.  At
last their progress was arrested by a dead-lock of vehicles
in front of them, caused by the breaking down of a streetcar.
The carriage drew up near the sidewalk in front of
a confectioner’s.  On Nora’s regretting the delay, and
saying she was ravenous for lunch, Hubert went into the
shop, and returned with a bundle of tarts.  The rain
came down in sheeted torrents, so that they had to close
both the windows.  Circled about with this watery screen,
they feasted on their tarts with peculiar relish.  In a
short time Hubert made another excursion, and returned
with a second course.  His diving to and fro in the rain
excited them to extravagant mirth.  Nora had bought
some pocket-handkerchiefs, which were in that cohesive
state common to these articles in the shop.  It seemed a
very pretty joke to spread the piece across their knees as
a table-cloth.
</p>

<p>
“To think of picnicking in the midst of Washington
Street!” cried Nora, with her lips besprinkled with
flakes of pastry.
</p>

<p>
“For a young lady about to leave her native land, her
home, and friends, and all that is dear to her,” said
Hubert, “you seem to me in very good spirits.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t speak of it,” said Nora.  “I shall cry
to-night; it is feverish gayety.”
</p>

<p>
“You will not be able to do this kind of thing abroad,”
said Hubert.  “Do you know we are monstrously improper?
For a young girl it’s by no means pure gain,
going to Europe.  She comes into a very pretty heritage
of prohibitions.  You have no idea of the number of
improper things a young girl can do.  You are walking on
the edge of a precipice.  Don’t look over or you will lose
your head and never walk straight again.  Here, you are
all blindfold.  Promise me not to lose this blessed
bandage of American innocence.  Promise me that, when you
come back, we shall spend another morning together as
free and delightful as this one!”
</p>

<p>
“I promise you!” said Nora; but Hubert’s words
had potently foreshadowed the forfeiture of sweet
possibilities.  For the rest of the drive she was in a graver
mood.  They found Roger beneath the portico of the
hotel, watch in hand, staring up and down the street.
Preceding events having been explained to him, he
offered to drive his cousin home.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose Nora has told you,” he began, as they
proceeded.
</p>

<p>
“Yes!  Well, I am sorry.  She is a charming girl.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” Roger cried: “I knew you thought so!”

<p>
“You are as knowing as ever!  She sails, she tells me,
on Wednesday next.  And you, when do you sail?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t sail at all.  I am going home.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you sure of that?”
</p>

<p>
Roger gazed for a moment out of the window.  “I
mean for a year,” he said, “to allow her perfect
liberty.”
</p>

<p>
“And to accept the consequences?”
</p>

<p>
“Absolutely.”  And Roger folded his arms.
</p>

<p>
This conversation took place on a Friday.  Nora was
to sail from New York on the succeeding Wednesday;
for which purpose she was to leave Boston with Mrs. Keith
on the Monday.  The two ladies were of course to
be attended to the ship by Roger.  Early Sunday morning
Nora received a visit from her friend.  The reader
will perhaps remember that Mrs. Keith was a recent
convert to the Roman Catholic faith; as such, she
performed her religious duties with peculiar assiduity.  Her
present errand was to propose that Nora should go with
her to church and join in offering a mass for their safety
at sea.  “I don’t want to bring you over, you know;
but I think it would be so nice,” said Mrs. Keith.
Appealing to Roger, Nora received permission to do as she
chose; she therefore lent herself with fervor to this pious
enterprise.  The two ladies spent an hour at the foot of
the altar,—an hour of romantic delight to the younger
one.  On Sunday evening Roger, who, as the day of
separation approached, became painfully anxious and reluctant,
betook himself to Mrs. Keith, with the desire to enforce
upon her mind a solemn sense of her responsibilities
and of the value of the treasure he had confided to her.
Nora, left alone, sat wondering whether Hubert might
not come to bid her farewell.  Wandering listlessly about
the room, her eye fell on the Saturday-evening paper.
She took it up and glanced down the columns.  In one
of them she perceived a list of the various church services
of the morrow.  Last in the line stood this announcement:
“At the —— —— Church, the Rev. Hubert Lawrence,
at eight o’clock.”  It gave her a gentle shock; it
destroyed the vision of his coming in and their having,
under the lamp, by the fire, the serious counterpart of
their frolicsome <i>tête-à-tête</i> in the carriage.  She longed
to show him that she was not a giggling child, but a wise
young lady.  But no; in a dimly-crowded church,
before a hundred eyes, he was speaking of divine things.
How did he look in the pulpit?  If she could only see
him!  And why not?  She looked at her watch; it
lacked ten minutes to eight.  She made no pause to
reflect; she only felt that she must hurry.  She rang the
bell and ordered a carriage, and then, hastening to her
room, put on her shawl and bonnet,—the blue crape
bonnet of the concert.  In a few moments she was on
her way to the church.  When she reached it, her heart
was beating fast; she was on the point of turning back.
But the coachman opened the carriage door with such a
flourish that she was ashamed not to get out.  She was
late; the church was full, the service had gone forward,
the sermon was about to begin.  The sexton with great
solemnity conducted her up the aisle to a pew directly
beneath the pulpit.  She bent her eyes on the ground,
but she knew that there was a deep expectant silence,
and that Hubert was upright before the desk looking at
her.  She sat down beside a very grim-visaged old lady
with bushy eyebrows, who stared at her so hard, that to
hide her confusion she buried her head and prolonged her
prayer; upon which the old lady seemed to stare more
intently, as if she thought her very pretentious.  When
she raised her head, Hubert had begun to speak; he was
looking above her and beyond her, and during the
sermon his level glance never met her own.  Of what did
he speak and what was the moral of his discourse?  Nora
could not have told you; yet not a soul in the audience,
not all those listening souls together, were more devoutly
attentive than she.  But it was not on what he said, but
on what he was, or seemed to be, that her perception
was centred.  Hubert Lawrence had an excellent gift of
oratory.  His voice was full of penetrating sweetness,
and, modulated with infinite art, it sank with a silvery
cadence.  His speech was silver, though I doubt whether
his silence was ever golden.  His utterance seemed to
Nora the perfection of eloquence.  She thought of her
uplifted feeling in the morning, in the incense-thickened
air of the Catholic church; but what a straighter flight
to heaven was this!  Hubert’s week-day face was a
summer cloud, with a lining of celestial brightness.  Now,
how the divine truth overlapped its relenting edges and
seemed to transform it into a dazzling focus of light!
He spoke for half an hour, but Nora took no note of
time.  As the service drew to a close, he gave her from
the pulpit a rapid glance, which she interpreted as a
request to remain.  When the congregation began to
disperse, a number of persons, chiefly ladies, waited for him
near the pulpit, and, as he came down, met him with
greetings and compliments.  Nora watched him from her
place, listening, smiling, and passing his handkerchief
over his forehead.  At last they released him, and he
came up to her.  She remembered for years afterward
the strange half-smile on his face.  There was something
in it like a pair of eyes peeping over a wall.  It seemed
to express so fine an acquiescence in what she had done,
that, for the moment, she had a startled sense of having
committed herself to something.  He gave her his hand,
without manifesting any surprise.  “How did you get
here?”
</p>

<p>
“In a carriage.  I saw it in the paper at the last
moment.”
</p>

<p>
“Does Roger know you came?”
</p>

<p>
“No; he had gone to Mrs. Keith’s.”
</p>

<p>
“So you started off alone, at a moment’s notice?”
</p>

<p>
She nodded, blushing.  He was still holding her
hand; he pressed it and dropped it.  “O Hubert,”
cried Nora, suddenly, “now I know you!”
</p>

<p>
Two ladies were lingering near, apparently mother and
daughter.  “I must be civil to them,” he said: “they
have come from New York to hear me.”  He quickly
rejoined them and conducted them toward their carriage.
The younger one was extremely pretty, and looked a
little like a Jewess.  Nora observed that she wore a great
diamond in each ear; she eyed our heroine rather severely
as they passed.  In a few minutes Hubert came back,
and, before she knew it, she had taken his arm and he
was beside her in her own carriage.  They drove to the
hotel in silence; he went up stairs with her.  Roger had
not returned.  “Mrs. Keith is very agreeable,” said
Hubert.  “But Roger knew that long ago.  I suppose
you have heard,” he added: “but perhaps you have not
heard.”
</p>

<p>
“I have not heard,” said Nora, “but I have suspected—”
</p>

<p>
“What?”
</p>

<p>
“No; it is for you to say.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, that Mrs. Keith might have been Mrs. Lawrence.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, I was right,—I was right,” murmured Nora,
with a little air of triumph.  “She may be still.  I wish
she would!”  Nora was removing her bonnet before the
mirror over the chimney-piece; as she spoke, she caught
Hubert’s eye in the glass.  He dropped it and took up
his hat.  “Won’t you wait?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
He said he thought he had better go, but he lingered
without sitting down.  Nora walked about the room,
she hardly knew why, smoothing the table-covers and
rearranging the chairs.
</p>

<p>
“Did you cry about your departure, the other night,
as you promised?” Hubert asked.
</p>

<p>
“I confess that I was so tired with our adventures
that I went straight to sleep.”
</p>

<p>
“Keep your tears for a better cause.  One of the
greatest pleasures in life is in store for you.  There are a
hundred things I should like to say to you about Rome.
How I only wish I were going to show it you!  Let me
beg you to go some day to a little place in the Via Felice,
on the Pincian,—a house with a terrace adjoining the
fourth floor.  There is a plasterer’s shop in the basement.
You can reach the terrace by the common staircase.  I
occupied the rooms adjoining it, and it was my peculiar
property.  I remember I used often to share it with a
poor little American sculptress who lived below.  She
made my bust; the Apollo Belvedere was nothing to it.
I wonder what has become of her!  Take a look at the
view,—the view I woke up to every morning, read by,
studied by, lived by.  I used to alternate my periods of
sight-seeing with fits of passionate study.  In another
winter I think I might have learned something.  Your
real lover of Rome oscillates with a kind of delicious pain
between the city in itself and the city in literature.  They
keep forever referring you to each other and bandying
you to and fro.  If we had eyes for metaphysical things,
Nora, you might see a hundred odd bits of old ambitions
and day-dreams strewing that little terrace.  Ah, as I sat
there, how the Campagna used to take up the tale and
respond to my printed page!  If I know anything of the
lesson of history (a man of my profession is supposed to),
I learned it in that enchanted air!  I should like to
know who is sitting in the same school now.  Perhaps
you will write me a word.”
</p>

<p>
“I will piously gather up the crumbs of your feasts
and make a meal of them,” said Nora.  “I will let you
know how they taste.”
</p>

<p>
“Pray do.  And one more request.  Don’t let Mrs. Keith
make a Catholic of you.”  And he put out his
hand.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head slowly; as she took it.  “I will
have no Pope but you,” she said.
</p>

<p>
And after that he went.

<div class='chapter'><h2>VI.</h2></div>

<p>
Roger had assured his cousin that he meant to
return home, and indeed, after Nora’s departure,
he spent a fortnight in the country.  But finding
he had no patience left for solitude, he again came to
town and established himself for the winter.  A restless
need of getting rid of time caused him to resume his
earlier social habits.  It began to be said of him that now
he had disposed of that queer little girl that he had
picked up Heaven knew where (whom it was certainly
very good-natured of Mrs. Keith to take off his hands),
he was going to look about him for a young person whom
he might take to his home in earnest.  Roger felt as if
he were now establishing himself in society in behalf of
that larger personality into which his narrow singleness
was destined to expand.  He was paving the way for
Nora.  It seemed to him that she might find it an easy
way to tread.  He compared her attentively with every
young girl he met; many were prettier, some possessed
in larger degree the air of “brightness”; but none
revealed that deep-shrined natural force, lurking in the
shadow of modesty like a statue in a recess, which you
hardly know whether to denominate humility or pride.
</p>

<p>
One evening, at a large party, Roger found himself
approached by an elderly lady who had known him from
his boyhood and for whom he had a traditional regard,
but with whom of late years he had relaxed his
intercourse, from a feeling that, being a very worldly old
woman, her influence on Nora might be pernicious.  She
had never smiled on the episode of which Nora was the
heroine, and she hailed Roger’s reappearance as a sign
that this episode was at an end and that he had
repented of his abrupt eccentricity.  She was somewhat
cynical in her shrewdness, and, so far as she might, she
handled matters without gloves.
</p>

<p>
“I am glad to see you have found your wits again,”
she said, “and that that forlorn little orphan—Dora,
Flora, what’s her name?—has not altogether made a
fool of you.  You want to marry; come, don’t deny it.
You can no more remain unmarried than I can remain
standing here.  Go ask that little man for his chair.
With your means and your disposition and all the rest
of it, you ought by this time to be setting a good
example.  But it’s never too late to mend.  I have got
the thing for you.  Have you been introduced to Miss
Sands?  Who is Miss Sands?  There you are to the
life!  Miss Sands is Miss Sands, the young lady in whose
honor we are here convened.  She is staying with my
sister.  You must have heard of her.  New York, but
good New York; so pretty that she might be as silly as
you please, yet as clever and good as if she were as plain
as I.  She is everything a man can want.  If you have
not seen her it’s providential.  Come; don’t protest for
the sake of protesting.  I have thought it all out.
Allow me! in this matter I am a woman of genius.  I know
at a glance what will do and what won’t.  You are made
for each other.  Come and be presented.  You have just
time to settle down to it before supper.”
</p>

<p>
Then came into Roger’s honest visage a sort of
Mephistophelian glee,—the momentary intoxication of duplicity.
“Well, well,” he said, “let us see all that’s to be seen.”  And
he thought of his Peruvian Teresa.  Miss Sands,
however, proved no Teresa, and Roger’s friend had not
overstated her merits.  Her beauty was remarkable; and
strangely, in spite of her blooming maturity, something
in her expression, her smile, reminded him forcibly of
Nora.  So Nora might look after ten or twelve years of
evening parties.  There was a hint, just a hint, of
customary triumph in the poise of her head, an air of serene
success in her carriage; but it was her especial charm
that she seemed to melt downward and condescend from
this altitude of loveliness with a benignant and considerate
grace; to drop, as it were, from the zenith of her
favor, with a little shake of invitation, the silken cable
of a gradual smile.  Roger felt that there was so little
to be feared from her that he actually enjoyed the mere
surface-glow of his admiration; the sense of floating
unmelted in the genial zone of her presence, like a polar
ice-block in a summer sea.  The more he observed her,
the more she seemed to foreshadow his prospective Nora;
so that at last, borrowing confidence from this phantasmal
identity, he addressed her with unaffected friendliness.
Miss Sands, who was a woman of perceptions, seeing an
obviously modest man swimming, as it were, in this
mystical calm, became interested.  She divined in Roger’s
manner an unusual species of admiration.  She had feasted
her fill on uttered flattery; but here was a good man
whose appreciation left compliments far behind.  At the
end of ten minutes Roger mentioned that she reminded
him singularly of a young girl he knew.  “A young girl,
forsooth,” thought Miss Sands.  “Is he coming to his
<i>fadaises</i>, like the rest of them?”
</p>

<p>
“You are older than she,” Roger added, “but I
expect her to look like you some time hence.”
</p>

<p>
“I gladly bequeath her my youth, as I come to give
it up.”
</p>

<p>
“You can never have been plain,” said Roger.  “My
friend, just now, is no beauty.  But I assure you, you
encourage me.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me about this young lady,” his companion rejoined.
“It is interesting to hear about people one looks
like.”
</p>

<p>
“I should like to tell you,” said Roger, “but you
would laugh at me.”
</p>

<p>
“You do me injustice.  Evidently this is a matter of
sentiment.  Genuine sentiment is the best thing in the
world; and when I catch myself laughing at a mortal
who confesses to it, I submit to being told that I have
grown old only to grow silly.”
</p>

<p>
Roger smiled approval.  “I can only say,” he answered,
“that this young friend of mine is, to me, the
most interesting object in the world.”
</p>

<p>
“In other words, you are engaged to marry her.”
</p>

<p>
“Not a bit of it.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, then, she is a deaf-mute whom you have rendered
vocal, or a pretty heathen whom you have brought
to Sunday school.”
</p>

<p>
Roger laughed exuberantly.  “You have hit it,” he
said: “a deaf-mute whom I have taught to speak.  Add
to that, that she was a little blind, and that now she
recognizes me with spectacles, and you will admit that I
have reason to be proud of my work.”  Then, after a
pause he pursued, seriously, “If anything were to
happen to her—”
</p>

<p>
“If she were to lose her faculties—”
</p>

<p>
“I should be in despair.  But I know what I should
do.  I should come to you.”
</p>

<p>
“O, I should be a poor substitute!”
</p>

<p>
“I should make love to you,” Roger went on.
</p>

<p>
“You would be in despair indeed.  But you must bring
me some supper.”
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, as the ladies were cloaking
themselves, Mrs. Middleton, who had undertaken Roger’s
case, asked Miss Sands for her impressions.  These
seemed to have been highly propitious.  “He is not a
shining light, perhaps,” the young lady said, “but he is
an honest man.  He is in earnest; after what I have
been through, that is very pleasant.  And by the way,
what is this little deaf and dumb girl in whom he is
interested?”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Middleton stared.  “I never heard she was deaf
and dumb.  Very likely.  He adopted her and brought her
up.  He has sent her abroad—to learn the languages!”
</p>

<p>
Miss Sands mused as they descended the stairs.  “He
is a good man,” she said.  “I like him.”
</p>

<p>
It was in consequence, doubtless, of this last remark
that Roger, the next morning, received a note from his
friend.  “You have made a hit; I shall never forgive
you, if you don’t follow it up.  You have only to be
decently civil and then propose.  Come and dine with me
on Wednesday.  I shall have only one guest.  You know
I always take a nap after dinner.”
</p>

<p>
The same post that brought Mrs. Middleton’s note
brought a letter from Nora.  It was dated from Rome,
and ran as follows:—
</p>

<p>
“I hardly know, dearest Roger, whether to begin with
an apology or a scolding.  We have each something to
forgive, but you have certainly least.  I have before me
your two poor little notes, which I have been reading
over for the twentieth time; trying, in this city of
miracles, to work upon them the miracle of the loaves and
fishes.  But the miracle won’t come; they remain only
two very much bethumbed epistles.  Dear Roger, I
have been extremely vexed and uneasy.  I have fancied
you were ill, or, worse,—that out of sight is out
of mind.  It is not with me, I assure you.  I have written
you <i>twelve</i> little letters.  They have been short only
because I have been horribly busy.  To-day I declined
an invitation to drive on the Campagna, on purpose to
write to you.  The Campagna,—do you hear?  I can
hardly believe that, five months ago, I was watching the
ripe apples drop in the orchard at C——.  We are
always on our second floor on the Pincian, with plenty of
sun, which you know is the great necessity here.  Close
at hand are the great steps of the Piazza di Spagna,
where the beggars and models sit at the receipt of
custom.  Some of them are so handsome, sunning themselves
there in their picturesqueness, that I cannot help
wishing I knew how to paint or draw.  I wish I had been
a good girl three years ago and done as you wished,
and taken drawing-lessons in earnest.  Dear Roger,
I never neglected your advice but to my cost.  Mrs. Keith
is extremely kind, and determined I shall have
not come abroad to ‘mope,’ as she says.  She does not
care much for sight-seeing, having done it all before;
though she keeps pretty well <i>au courant</i> of the various
church festivals.  She very often talks of you, and is very
fond of you.  She is full of good points, but that is her
best one.  My own sight-seeing habits do not at all
incommode her, owing to my having made the acquaintance
of a little old German lady who lives at the top of our
house.  She is a queer wizened oddity of a woman, but
she is very clever and friendly, and she has the things of
Rome on her fingers’ ends.  The reason of her being here
is very sad and beautiful.  Twelve years ago her younger
sister, a beautiful girl (she has shown me her miniature),
was deceived and abandoned by her betrothed.  She fled
away from her home, and after many weary wanderings
found her way to Rome, and gained admission to the
convent with the dreadful name,—the Sepolte Vive.
Here, ever since, she has been immured.  The inmates
are literally buried alive; they are dead to the outer
world.  My poor little Mademoiselle Stamm followed her
and took up her dwelling here, to be near her.  But they
have a dead stone wall between them.  For twelve years
she has never seen her.  Her only communication with
Lisa—her conventual name she doesn’t even know—is
once a week to deposit a bouquet of flowers, with her
name attached, in the little blind wicket of the convent
wall.  To do this with her own hands, she lives in Rome.
She composes her bouquet with a kind of passion; I have
seen her and helped her.  Fortunately flowers in Rome
are very cheap, for my friend is deplorably poor.  I have
had a little pleasure, or rather a great pleasure.  For the
past two months I have furnished the flowers, and I
assure you we have had the best.  I go each time with
Mademoiselle Stamm to the wicket, and we put in our
bouquet and see it gobbled up into the speechless maw
of the cloister.  It is a dismal amusement, but I confess
it interests me.  I feel as if I knew this poor Lisa;
though, after all, she may be dead, and we may be
worshipping a shadow.  But in this city of shadows and
memories, what is one shadow the more?  Don’t think,
however, that we spend all our time in playing with
shadows.  We go everywhere, we see everything; I
could not be in better hands.  Mrs. Keith has doubts
about my friend’s moral influence; she accuses her of
being a German philosopher in petticoats.  She is a
German, she wears petticoats; and having known poverty
and unhappiness, she is obliged to be something of a
philosopher.  As for her metaphysics, they may be very
wicked, but I should be too stupid to understand them,
and it is less trouble to abide by my own—and
Mrs. Keith’s!  At all events, I have told her all about you,
and she says you are the one good man she ever heard
of; so it’s not for you to disapprove of her!  My
mornings I spend with her; after lunch I go out with
Mrs. Keith.  We drive to the various villas, make visits upon
all kinds of people, go to studios and churches and
palaces.  In the evenings we hold high revel.  Mrs. Keith
knows every one; she receives a great many people, and
we go out in proportion.  It is a most amusing world.
I have seen more people in the last six weeks than I ever
expected to in a lifetime.  I feel so old,—you wouldn’t
know me!  One grows more in a month in this wonderful
Rome than in a year at home.  Mrs. Keith is very
much liked and admired.  She has lightened her mourning
and looks much better; but, as she says, she will
never be herself till she gets back to pink.  As for me,
I wear pink and blue and every color of the rainbow.  It
appears that everything suits me; there is no spoiling
me.  Of course, I am <i>out</i>,—a thousand miles out.  I
came out six weeks ago at the great ball of the Princess
X.  How the Princess X.—poor lady!—came to serve
my turn, is more than I can say; but Mrs. Keith is a
fairy godmother; she shod me in glass slippers and we
went.  I fortunately came home with my slippers on my
feet.  I was very much frightened when we went in.  I
courtesied to the Princess: and the Princess stared
good-naturedly; while I heard Mrs. Keith behind me
whispering, ‘Lower, lower!’  But I have yet to learn how
to courtesy to condescending princesses.  Now I can
drop a little bow to a good old cardinal as smartly as you
please.  Mrs. Keith has presented me to half a dozen,
with whom I pass, I suppose, for an interesting convert.
Alas, I am only a convert to worldly vanities, which I
confess I vastly enjoy.  Dear Roger, I am hopelessly
frivolous.  The shrinking diffidence of childhood I have
utterly cast away.  I speak up at people as bold as brass.
I like having them introduced to me, and having to be
interested and interesting at a moment’s notice.  I like
listening and watching; I like sitting up to the small
hours; I like talking myself.  But I need hardly to tell
you this, at the end of my ten pages of chatter.  I have
talked about my own affairs, because I know they will
interest you.  Profit by my good example, and tell
me all about yours.  Do you miss me?  I have read
over and over your two little notes, to find some little
hint that you do; but not a word!  I confess I wouldn’t
have you too unhappy.  I am so glad to hear you are in
town, and not at that dreary, wintry C——.  Is our old
C—— life at an end, I wonder?  Nothing can ever be
the same after a winter in Rome.  Sometimes I am half
frightened at having had it in my youth.  It leaves such
a chance to be dull afterwards!  But I shall come back
some day with you.  And not even the Princess X. shall
make me forget my winter seat by the library fire at
C——, my summer seat under the great elm.”
</p>

<p>
This production seemed to Roger a marvel of intellectual
promise and epistolary grace; it filled his eyes
with grateful tears; he carried it in his pocket-book and
read it to a dozen people.  His tears, however, were
partly those of penitence, as well as of delight.  He had
had a purpose in preserving that silence, which had cost
so much to his good-nature.  He wished to make Nora
miss him, and to let silence combine with absence to plead
for him.  Had he succeeded?  Not too well, it would
seem; yet well enough to make him feel that he had
been cruel.  His letter occupied him so intensely that it
was not till within an hour of Mrs. Middleton’s dinner
that he remembered his engagement.  In the drawing-room
he found Miss Sands, looking even more beautiful
in a dark high-necked dress than in the glory of gauze
and flowers.  During dinner he was in excellent spirits;
he uttered perhaps no epigrams, but he gave, by his
laughter, an epigrammatic turn to the ladyish gossip of
his companions.  Mrs. Middleton entertained the best
hopes.  When they had left the table she betook herself
to her arm-chair, and erected a little hand-screen before
her face, behind which she slept or not, as you choose.
Roger, suddenly bethinking himself that if Miss Sands
had been made a party to the old lady’s views, his
alacrity of manner might compromise him, checked his
vivacity, and asked his companion stiffly if she played
the piano.  On her confessing to this accomplishment, he
of course proceeded to open the instrument which stood
in the adjoining room.  Here Miss Sands sat down and
played with great resolution an exquisite composition of
Schubert.  As she struck the last note he uttered some
superlative of praise.  She was silent for a moment, and
then, “That is a thing I rarely play,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“It is very difficult, I suppose.”
</p>

<p>
“It is not only difficult, but it is too sad.”
</p>

<p>
“Sad!” cried Roger, “I should call it very joyous.”
</p>

<p>
“You must be in very good spirits!  I take it to have
been meant for pure sadness.  This is what should suit
your mood!” and she attacked with great animation one
of Strauss’s waltzes.  But she had played but a dozen
chords when he interrupted her.  “Spare me,” he said.
“I may be glad, but not with that gladness.  I confess
that I am in spirits.  I have just had a letter from that
young friend of whom I spoke to you.”
</p>

<p>
“Your adopted daughter?  Mrs. Middleton told me
about her.”
</p>

<p>
“Mrs. Middleton,” said Roger, in downright fashion,
“knows nothing about her.  Mrs. Middleton,” and he
lowered his voice and laughed, “is not an oracle of
wisdom.”  He glanced into the other room at their hostess
and her complaisant screen.  He felt with peculiar
intensity that, whether she was napping or no, she was
a sadly superficial,—in fact a positively immoral,—old
woman.  It seemed absurd to believe that this fair, wise
creature before him had lent herself to a scheme of such
a one’s making.  He looked awhile at her deep clear
eyes and her gracious lips.  It would be a satisfaction
to smile with her over Mrs. Middleton’s machinations.
“Do you know what she wants to do with us?” he went
on.  “She wants to make a match between us.”
</p>

<p>
He waited for her smile, but it was heralded by a
blush,—a blush portentous, formidable, tragical.  Like
a sudden glow of sunset in a noonday sky, it covered
her fair face and burned on her cloudless brow.  “The
deuce!” thought Roger.  “Can it be,—can it be?”  The
smile he had invoked followed fast; but this was
not the order of nature.
</p>

<p>
“A match between <i>us</i>!” said Miss Sands.  “What a
brilliant idea!”
</p>

<p>
“Not that I cannot easily imagine falling in love with
you,” Roger rejoined: “but—but—”
</p>

<p>
“But you are in love with some one else.”  Her
eyes, for a moment, rested on him intently.  “With
your protégée!”
</p>

<p>
Roger hesitated.  It seemed odd to be making this
sacred confidence to a stranger; but with this matter of
Mrs. Middleton’s little arrangement between them, she
was hardly a stranger.  If he had offended her, too, the
part of gallantry was to admit everything.  “Yes, I am
in love!” he said.  “And with the young lady you so
much resemble.  She doesn’t know it.  Only one or two
persons know it, save yourself.  It is the secret of my
life, Miss Sands.  She is abroad.  I have wished to do
what I could for her.  It is an odd sort of position, you
know.  I have brought her up with the view of making
her my wife, but I have never breathed a word of it to
her.  She must choose for herself.  My hope is that she
will choose me.  But Heaven knows what turn she may
take, what may happen to her over there in Rome.  I
hope for the best; but I think of little else.  Meanwhile
I go about with a sober face, and eat and sleep and talk,
like the rest of the world; but all the while I am counting
the hours.  Really, I don’t know what has set me
going in this way.  I don’t suppose you will at all
understand my situation; but you are evidently so good that
I feel as if I might count on your sympathy.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Sands listened with her eyes bent downward, and
with great gravity.  When he had spoken, she gave him
her hand with a certain passionate abruptness.  “You have
my sympathy!” she said.  “Much good may it do you!
I know nothing of your friend, but it is hard to fancy her
disappointing you.  I perhaps don’t altogether enter into
your situation.  It is novel, but it is extremely interesting.
I hope before rejecting you she will think twice.  I
don’t bestow my esteem at random, but you have it,
Mr. Lawrence, absolutely.”  And with these words she rose.
At the same moment their hostess suspended her siesta,
and the conversation became general.  It can hardly be
said, however, to have prospered.  Miss Sands talked
with a certain gracious zeal which was not unallied, I
imagine, to a desire to efface the trace of that superb
blush I have attempted to chronicle.  Roger brooded
and wondered; and Mrs. Middleton, fancying that
things were not going well, expressed her displeasure by
abusing every one who was mentioned.  She took heart
again for the moment when, on the young lady’s carriage
being announced, the latter, turning in farewell to Roger,
asked him if he ever came to New York.  “When you
are next there,” she said, “you must make a point of
coming to see me.  You will have something to tell me.”
</p>

<p>
After she had gone Roger demanded of Mrs. Middleton
whether she had imparted to Miss Sands her scheme
for their common felicity.  “Never mind what I said or
did not say,” she replied.  “She knows enough not to
be taken unawares.  And now tell me—”  But Roger
would tell her nothing.  He made his escape, and as he
walked home in the frosty starlight, his face wore a
smile of the most shameless elation.  He had gone up in
the market.  Nora might do worse!  There stood that
beautiful woman knocking at his door.
</p>

<p>
A few evenings after this Roger called upon Hubert.
Not immediately, but on what may be called the second
line of conversation, Hubert asked him what news he had
from Nora.  Roger replied by reading her letter aloud.
For some moments after he had finished Hubert was
silent.  “‘One grows more in a month in this wonderful
Rome,’” he said at last, quoting, “‘than in a year at
home.’”
</p>

<p>
“Grow, grow, grow, and Heaven speed it!” said Roger.
</p>

<p>
“She is growing, you may depend upon it.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course she is; and yet,” said Roger, discriminatingly,
“there is a kind of girlish freshness, a childish
simplicity, in her style.”
</p>

<p>
“Strongly marked,” said Hubert, laughing.  “I have
just got a letter from her you would take to be written
by a child of ten.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>You</i> have a letter?”
</p>

<p>
“It came an hour ago.  Let me read it.”
</p>

<p>
“Had you written to her?”
</p>

<p>
“Not a word.  But you will see.”  And Hubert in
his dressing-gown, standing before the fire, with the
same silver-sounding accents Nora had admired, distilled
her own gentle prose into Roger’s attentive ear.
</p>

<p>
“‘I have not forgotten your asking me to write to you
about your beloved Pincian view.  Indeed, I have been
daily reminded of it by having that same view continually
before my eyes.  From my own window I see the same
dark Rome, the same blue Campagna.  I have rigorously
performed my promise, however, of ascending to your
little terrace.  I have an old German friend here, a
perfect archæologist in petticoats, in whose company I think
as little of climbing to terraces and towers as of diving
into catacombs and crypts.  We chose the finest day
of the winter, and made the pilgrimage together.  The
plaster-merchant is still in the basement.  We saw him
in his doorway, standing to dry, whitened over as if he
meant personally to be cast.  We reached your terrace
in safety.  It was flooded with light,—you know the
Roman light,—the yellow and the purple.  A young
painter who occupies your rooms had set up his easel
under an umbrella in the open air.  A young <i>contadina</i>
imported, I suppose, from the Piazza di Spagna, was
sitting to him in the sunshine, which deepened her brown
face, her blue-black hair, and her white head-cloth.  He
was flattering her to his heart’s content, and of course to
hers.  When I want my portrait painted, I shall know
where to go.  My friend explained to him that we had
come to look at his terrace on behalf of an unhappy
far-away American gentleman who had once been lodger
there.  Hereupon he was charmingly polite.  He showed
us the little <i>salotto</i>, the fragment of bas-relief inserted in
the wall,—was it there in your day?—and a dozen of
his own pictures.  One of them was a very pretty
version of the view from the terrace.  Does it betray an
indecent greed for applause to let you know that I bought
it, and that, if you are very good and write me a delightful
long letter, you shall have it when I get home?  It seemed
to me that you would be glad to learn that your little
habitation is not turned to baser uses, and that genius and
ambition may still be found there.  In your case, I
suppose, they were not found in company with dark-eyed
<i>contadine</i>, though they had an admirer in the person of
that poor little American sculptress.  I asked the young
painter if she had left any memory behind her.  Only a
memory, it appears.  She died a month after his arrival.
I never was so bountifully thanked for anything as for
buying our young man’s picture.  As he poured out his
lovely Italian gratitude, I felt like some patronizing duchess
of the Renaissance.  You will have to do your best, when
I transfer the picture to your hands, to give as pretty
a turn to your thanks.  This is only one specimen of a
hundred delightful rambles I have had with Mlle. Stamm.
We go a great deal to the churches; I never tire of them.
Not in the least that I am turning Papist; though in
Mrs. Keith’s society, if I chose to do so, I might treat
myself to the luxury of being a nine days’ wonder, (admire
my self-denial!) but because they are so picturesque
and historic; so redolent of memories, so rich with
traditions, so haunted with the past.  To go into most of the
churches is like reading some novel, better than I find most
novels.  They are for different days.  On a fine day, if
I have on my best bonnet, if I have been to a party the
night before, I like to go to Santa-Maria Maggiore.
Standing there, I dream, I dream, I dream; I should
be ashamed to tell you the nonsense I <i>do</i> dream!  On a
rainy day, when I tramp out with Mlle. Stamm in my
waterproof; when the evening before, instead of going to
a party, I have sat quietly at home reading Rio’s “Art
Chrétien” (recommended by the Abbé Leblond, Mrs. Keith’s
confessor), I like to go to the Ara Cœli.  There
you stand among the very bric-à-brac of Christian
history.  Something takes you at the throat,—but you
will have felt it; I needn’t try to define the indefinable.
Nevertheless, in spite of M. Rio and the Abbé Leblond
(he is a very charming old man too, and a keeper of
<i>ladies’</i> consciences, if there ever was one), there is small
danger of my changing my present faith for one that will make
it a sin to go and hear you preach.  Of course, we don’t
only haunt the churches.  I know in a way the Vatican,
the Capitol, and those charming galleries of the great
palaces.  Of course, you know them far better.  I am
stopped short on every side by my deplorable ignorance;
still, as far as may be given to a silly girl, I enjoy.  I
wish you were here, or that I knew some benevolent
man of culture.  My little German duenna is a marvel
of learning and communicativeness, and when she fairly
harangues me, I feel as if in my single person I were a
young ladies’ boarding-school.  But only a man can talk
really to the point of this manliest of cities.  Mrs. Keith
sees a great many gentlemen of one sort and another;
but what do they know of Brutus and Augustus, of
Emperors and Popes?  I shall keep my impressions, such as
they are, and we shall talk them over at our leisure.  I
shall bring home plenty of photographs; we shall have
charming evenings looking at them.  Roger writes that
he means next winter to take a furnished house in town.
You must come often and see us.  We are to spend the
summer in England....  Do you often see Roger?
I suppose so,—he wrote he was having a ‘capital
winter.’  By the way, I am ‘out.’  I go to balls and wear
Paris dresses.  I toil not, neither do I spin.  There is
apparently no end to my banker’s account, and Mrs. Keith
sets me a prodigious example of buying.  Is Roger
meanwhile going about with patched elbows?”
</p>

<p>
At this point Hubert stopped, and, on Roger’s asking
him if there was nothing more, declared that the rest was
private.  “As you please,” said Roger.  “By Jove! what
a letter,—what a letter!”
</p>

<p>
Several months later, in September, he hired for the
ensuing winter a small furnished house.  Mrs. Keith and
her companion were expected to reach home on the 10th
of October.  On the 6th, Roger took possession of his
house.  Most of the rooms had been repainted, and on
preparing to establish himself in one for the night, Roger
found that the fresh paint emitted such an odor as to
make his position untenable.  Exploring the premises, he
discovered in the lower regions, in a kind of sub-basement,
a small vacant apartment, destined to a servant, in
which he had a bed put up.  It was damp, but, as he
thought, not too damp, the basement being dry, as
basements go.  For three nights be occupied this room.  On
the fourth morning he woke up with a chill and a headache.
By noon he had a fever.  The physician, being
sent for, pronounced him seriously ill, and assured him
that he had been guilty of a gross imprudence.  He might
as well have slept in a burial-vault.  It was the first
sanitary indiscretion Roger had ever committed; he had a
dismal foreboding of its results.  Towards evening the
fever deepened, and he began to lose his head.  He was
still distinctly conscious that Nora was to arrive on the
morrow, and sadly disgusted that she was to find him in
this sorry plight.  It was a bitter disappointment that he
might not meet her at the steamer.  Still, Hubert might
go.  He sent for Hubert accordingly, who was brought
to his bedside.  “I shall be all right in a day or two,”
he said, “but meanwhile some one must receive Nora.
I know you will be glad to do it, you villain!”
</p>

<p>
Hubert declared that he was no villain, but that he
should be happy to perform this service.  As he looked
at his poor fever-stricken cousin, however, he doubted
strongly if Roger would be “all right” in a day or two.
On the morrow he went down to the ship.
</p>

<div class='chapter'><h2>VII.</h2></div>

<p>
On arriving at the landing-place of the European
steamer, Hubert found the passengers filing ashore
from the tug-boat in which they had been transferred
from the ship.  He instructed himself, as he took
his place near the gangway, to allow for a certain change
in Nora’s appearance; but even with this allowance none
of the various advancing ladies seemed to be Nora.
Suddenly he found himself confronted with a fair stranger, a
smile, and an outstretched hand.  The smile and the
offered hand of course proclaimed the young lady’s
identity.  Yet in spite of them, Hubert’s surprise was great;
his allowance had been too small.  But the next moment,
“Now you speak,” he said, “I recognize you”; and the
next he had greeted Mrs. Keith, who immediately
followed her companion; after which he ushered the two
ladies, with their servant and their various feminine
impedimenta, into a carriage.  Mrs. Keith was to return
directly to her own house, where, hospitable even amid
prospective chaos, she invited Hubert to join them at
dinner.  He had, of course, been obliged to inform Nora
offhand of the cause of Roger’s absence, though as yet
he made light of his illness.  It was agreed, however, that
Nora should remain with her companion until she had
communicated with her guardian.
</p>

<p>
Entering Mrs. Keith’s drawing-room a couple of hours
later, Hubert found the young girl on her knees before
the hearth.  He sat down near by, and in the glow of the
firelight he noted her altered aspect.  A year, somehow,
had made more than a year’s difference.  Hubert, in his
intercourse with women, was accustomed to indulge in a
sort of cool contemplation which, as a habit, found favor
according to the sensibility of the ladies touching whom
it was practised.  It had been intimated to him more than
once, that, in spite of his cloth, just a certain turn of the
head made this a license.  But on this occasion his gaze
was all respectful.  He was lost in admiration; for Nora
was beautiful.  She had left home a simple maiden of
common gifts, with no greater burden of loveliness than
the slender, angular, neutral grace of youth and freshness;
and here she stood, a mature, consummate, superb
young woman!  It was as if she had bloomed into ripeness
in the sunshine of a great contentment; as if, fed by
the sources of æsthetic delight, her nature had risen
calmly to its allotted level.  A singular harmony and
serenity seemed to pervade her person.  Her beauty lay
in no inordinate perfection of individual features, but in
the deep sweet fellowship that reigned between smile and
step and glance and tone.  The total effect was an
impression of the simplest and yet the richest loveliness.
“Pallas Athene,” said Hubert to himself, “sprang
full-armed, we are told, from the brain of Jove.  But we
have a Western version of the myth.  She was born in
Missouri; for years she wore aprons and carried
lesson-books.  Then one fine day she was eighteen, and she
sported a black silk dress of Paris!”  Meanwhile Pallas
Athene had been asking about Roger.  “Shall I see him
to-morrow, at least?” she demanded.
</p>

<p>
“I think not; he will not get out for several days.”
</p>

<p>
“But I can easily go to him.  It is very tiresome.
Things never turn out as we arrange them.  I had
arranged this meeting of ours to perfection!  He was to
dine with us here, and we were to talk, talk, talk, till
midnight; and then I was to go home with him; and
there we were to stand leaning on the banisters at his
room door, and talk, talk; talk till morning.”
</p>

<p>
“And where was I to be?” asked Hubert.
</p>

<p>
“I had not arranged for you.  But I expected to see
you to-morrow.  To-morrow I shall go to Roger.”
</p>

<p>
“If the doctor allows,” said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
Nora rose to her feet.  “You don’t mean to say, Hubert,
that it is as bad as <i>that</i>?”  She frowned a little and
bent her eyes eagerly on his face.  Hubert heard Mrs. Keith’s
voice in the hall; in a moment their tête-à-tête
would be at an end.  Instead of answering her
question,—“Nora,” he said, in his deepest, lowest voice, “you
are wonderfully beautiful!”  He caught her startled,
unsatisfied glance; then he turned and greeted
Mrs. Keith.  He had not pleased Nora, evidently; it was
premature.  So to efface the solemnity of his speech, he
repeated it aloud: “I tell Nora she is very beautiful!”
</p>

<p>
“Bah!” said Mrs. Keith: “you needn’t tell her;
she knows it.”
</p>

<p>
Nora smiled unconfusedly.  “O, say it all the same!”
</p>

<p>
“Was it not the French ambassador, in Rome,”
Mrs. Keith demanded, “who attacked you in that fashion?
He asked to be introduced.  There’s an honor!
‘<i>Mademoiselle, vous êtes parfaitement belle.</i>’”
</p>

<p>
“He was very ugly himself,” said Nora.
</p>

<p>
Hubert was a lover of the luxuries and splendors of
life.  He had no immediate personal need of them; he
could make his terms with narrow circumstances; but
his imagination was a born aristocrat.  He liked to be
reminded that certain things were,—ambassadors,
ambassadorial compliments, Old-World drawing-rooms with
duskily moulded ceilings.  Nora’s beauty, to his vision,
took a deeper color from this homage of an old starched
and embroidered diplomatist.  It was valid, it had passed
the ordeal.  He had little need at table to play at discreet
inattention.  Mrs. Keith, preoccupied with her housekeeping
and the “dreadful state” in which her freshly
departed tenants had left her rooms, indulged in a tragic
monologue and dispensed with responses.  Nora, looking
frankly at Hubert, consoled their hostess with gentle
optimism; and Hubert returned her looks, wondering.
He mused upon the mystery of beauty.  What sudden
magic had made her so handsome?  She was the same
tender slip of girlhood who had come trembling to hear
him preach a year before; the same, yet how different!
And how sufficient she had grown, withal, to her beauty!
How with the added burden had come an added strength,—with
the greater charm a greater force,—a force subtle,
sensitive, just faintly self-suspecting.  Then came the
thought that all this was Roger’s,—Roger’s speculation,
Roger’s property!  He pitied the poor fellow, lying
senseless and helpless instead of sitting there
delightedly, drawing her out and showing her off.  After
dinner Nora talked little, partly, as he felt, from anxiety
about her friend, and partly because of that natural
reserve of the altered mind when confronted with old
associations.  He would have been glad to believe that she
was taking pensive note of his own appearance.  He had
made his mark in her mind a twelvemonth before.
Innumerable scenes and figures had since passed over it;
but his figure, Nora now discovered, had not been
obliterated.  Fixed there indelibly, it had grown with the
growth of her imagination.  She knew that she had
changed, and she had wondered whether Hubert would
have lost favor with difference.  Would he suffer by
contrast with people she had seen?  Would he seem graceless,
colorless, common?  Little by little, as his presence
defined itself, it became plain to her that the Hubert of
the past had a lease of the future.  As he rose to take his
leave, she begged him to let her write a line to Roger,
which he might carry.
</p>

<p>
“He will not be able to read it,” said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
Nora mused.  “I will write it, nevertheless.  You
will place it by his bedside, and the moment he is better
he will find it at hand.”
</p>

<p>
When she had left the room, Mrs. Keith demanded
tribute.  “Have not I done well?  Have not I made a
charming girl of her?”
</p>

<p>
“She does you great credit,” said Hubert, with a
mental reservation.
</p>

<p>
“O, but wait awhile!  You have not seen her yet.
She is tired, and anxious about your cousin.  Wait till
she comes out.  My dear Mr. Lawrence, she is perfect.
She lacks nothing, she has nothing too much.  You must
do me justice.  I saw it all in the rough, and I knew
just what it wanted.  I wish she were my daughter: you
should see great doings!  And she’s as good as gold.
It’s her nature.  After all, unless your nature is right,
what are you?”  But before Hubert could reply to this
little philosophic proposition, Nora reappeared with her
note.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Mrs. Keith went to call officially
upon her mother-in-law; and Nora, left alone and thinking
much of Roger’s condition, conceived an intense desire
to see him.  He had never been so dear to her as now,
and no one’s right to be with him was equal to hers.  She
dressed hastily and repaired to the little dwelling they
were to have so happily occupied.  She was admitted by
her old friend Lucinda, who, between trouble and wonder,
found a thousand things to say.  Nora’s beauty had never
received warmer tribute than the affectionate marvellings
of this old woman who had known her early plainness so
well.  She led her into the drawing-room, opened the
windows and turned her about in the light, patted her
braided tresses, and rejoiced with motherly unction in her
tallness and straightness and elegance.  Of Roger she
spoke with tearful eyes.  “It would be for him to see
you, my dear,” she said: “he would not be disappointed.
You are better than his brightest dreams.  O, I know all
about it!  He used to talk to me evenings, after you
were in bed.  ‘Lucinda, do you think she’s pretty?
Lucinda, do you think she’s plain?  Lucinda, do you dress
her warm?  Lucinda, have you changed her shoes?  And
mind, Lucinda, take good care of her hair; it’s the only
thing we are sure of!’  Yes, my dear, you have me to
thank for these big braids.  Would he feel sure of you
now, poor man?  You must keep yourself in cotton-wool
till he recovers.  You are like a picture; you ought to be
enclosed in a gilt frame and stand against the wall.”  Lucinda
begged, however, that Nora would not insist upon
seeing him; and her great reluctance betraying his evil
case, Nora consented to wait.  Her own small experience
could avail nothing.  “He is flighty,” said Lucinda, “and
I’m afraid he wouldn’t recognize you.  If he shouldn’t,
it would do you no good; and if he should, it would do
him none; it would increase his fever.  He’s bad, my
dear, he’s bad; but leave him to me!  I nursed him as
a baby; I nursed him as a boy; I will nurse him as a
man grown.  I have seen him worse than this, with the
scarlet fever at college, when his poor mother was dying
at home.  Baby, boy, and man, he has always had the
patience of a saint.  I will keep him for you, Miss Nora,
now I have seen you!  I shouldn’t dare to meet him in
heaven, if I were to let him miss you!”
</p>

<p>
When Lucinda had returned to her bedside duties,
Nora wandered about the house with a soundless tread,
taking melancholy note of the preparations Roger had
made for her return.  His choice, his taste, his ingenuity,
were everywhere visible.  The best beloved of her possessions
from the old house in the country had been transferred
hither and placed in such kindly half-lights as
would temper justice with mercy; others had found
expensive substitutes.  Nora went into the drawing-room,
where the blinds were closed and the chairs and sofas
shrouded in brown linen, and sat sadly revolving
possibilities.  How, with Roger’s death, loneliness again would
close about her; how he was her world, her strength, her
fate!  He had made her life; she needed him still to
watch his work.  She seemed to apprehend, as by a sudden
supernatural light, the extent of his affection and his
wisdom.  In the perfect stillness of the house she could
almost hear his tread on the stairs, hear his voice utter
her name with that tender adjustment of tone which
conveyed a benediction in a commonplace.  Her heart rose
to her throat; she felt a passionate desire to scream.  She
buried her head in a cushion to stifle the sound; her silent
tears fell upon the silk.  Suddenly she heard a step in the
hall; she had only time to brush them away before
Hubert Lawrence came in.  He greeted her with surprise.
“I came to bring your note,” he said: “I did not expect
to find you.’”
</p>

<p>
“Where better should I be?” she asked, with intensity.
“I can do nothing here, but I should look ill elsewhere.
Give me back my note, please.  It does not say
half I feel.”  He gave it back, and stood watching her
while she tore it in bits and threw it into the empty
fireplace.  “I have been wandering over the house,” she
added.  “Everything tells me of poor Roger.”  She felt
an indefinable need of protesting of her affection for him.
“I never knew till now,” she said, “how much I loved
him.  I am sure you don’t know him, Hubert; not as I
do.  I don’t believe any one does.  People always speak
of him with a little air of amusement.  Even Mrs. Keith
is witty at his expense.  But I know him; I grew to
know him in thinking of him while I was away.  There
is more of him than the world knows or than the world
would ever know, if it were left to his modesty and the
world’s stupidity!”  Hubert began to smile at her
eloquence.  “But I mean to put an end to his modesty.  I
mean to say, ‘Come, Roger, hold up your head and
speak out your mind and do yourself justice.’  I have
seen people without a quarter of his goodness who had
twenty times his assurance and his success.  I shall turn
the tables!  People shall have no favor from me, unless
they are good to Roger.  If they want me, they must
take him too.  They tell me I am a beauty, and I can do
what I please.  We shall see.  The first thing I shall do
will be to make them show him a great deal of respect.”
</p>

<p>
“I admire your spirit,” said Hubert.  “Dr. Johnson
liked a good hater; I like a good lover.  On the whole,
it’s more rarely found.  But aren’t you the least bit
Quixotic, with your terrible loyalty?  No one denies
that Roger is the best of the best of the best!  But do
what you please, Nora, you cannot make virtue entertaining.
As a clergyman, you know, I have had to try it.
But it’s no use; there’s a fatal family likeness between
goodness and dulness.  Of course you are fond of Roger.
So am I, so is every one in his heart of hearts.  But
what are we to do about it?  The kindest thing is to
leave him alone.  His virtues are his own affair.  You
describe him perfectly when you say that everything in
the house here sings his praise,—already, before he has
been here ten days!  The chairs are all straight, the
pictures are admirably hung, the locks are oiled, the winter
fuel is stocked, the bills are paid!  Look at the tidies
pinned on the chairs.  I will warrant you he pinned them
with his own hands.  Such is Roger!  Such virtues, in
a household, are priceless.  He ought never to marry;
his wife would die for want of occupation.  What society
cares for in a man is not his household virtues, but his
worldly ones.  I am talking now, of course, as a man of
the world.  Society wants to see things by the large end
of the telescope, not by the small.  ‘Be as good as you
please,’ it says, ‘but unless you are interesting, I’ll none
of you!’”
</p>

<p>
“Interesting!” cried Nora, with a rosy flush.  “I
have seen some very interesting people who have bored
me to death.  But if people don’t care for Roger, it’s
their own loss!”  Pausing a moment she fixed Hubert
with the searching candor of her gaze.  “You are
unjust,” she said.
</p>

<p>
This charge was pleasant to the young man’s soul;
he would not, for the world, have summarily rebutted
it.  “Explain, dear cousin,” he said, smiling kindly.
“Wherein am I unjust?”
</p>

<p>
It was the first time he had called her cousin; the
word made a sweet confusion in her thoughts.  But
looking at him still while she collected them, “You don’t
care to know!” she cried.  “Not when you smile so!
You are laughing at me, at Roger, at every one!”  Clever
men had ere this been called dreadfully satirical
by pretty women; but never, surely, with just that
imperious naïveté.  She spoke with a kind of joy in her
frankness; the sense of intimacy with the young man
had effaced the sense of difference.
</p>

<p>
“The scoffing fiend!  That’s a pretty character to
give a clergyman!” said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
“Are you, at heart, a clergyman?  I have been wondering.”
</p>

<p>
“You have heard me preach.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, a year ago, when I was a silly little girl.  I
want to hear you again.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I have gained my crown, I propose to keep it.
I would rather not be found out.  Besides, I am not
preaching now; I am resting.  Some people think me a
clergyman, Nora,” he said, lowering his voice with a hint
of mock humility.  “But do you know you are formidable,
with your fierce friendships and your jealous
suspicions?  If you doubt of me, well and good.  Let me
walk like an Homeric god in a cloud; without my cloud,
I should be sadly ungodlike.  Indeed, for that matter, I
doubt of myself.  But I don’t really undervalue Roger.
I love him, I admire him, I envy him.  I would give the
world to be able to exchange my restless imagination for
his silent, sturdy usefulness.  I feel as if I were toiling
in the sun, and he were sitting under green trees resting
from an effort which he has never needed to make.  Well,
virtue, I suppose, is welcome to the shade.  It’s cool, but
it’s dreadfully obscure!  People are free to find out the
best and the worst of <i>me</i>!  Here I stand, with all my
imperfections on my head; tricked out with a surplice,
baptized with a <i>reverend</i>, (Heaven save the mark!)
equipped with platform and pulpit and text and
audience,—erected into a mouthpiece of the spiritual aspirations
of mankind.  Well, I confess our sins; that’s good
humble-minded work.  And I must say, in justice, that when
once I don my surplice (I insist on the surplice, I can do
nothing without it) and mount into the pulpit, I feel
conscious of a certain power.  They call it eloquence; I
suppose it is.  I don’t know what it’s worth, but they seem
to like it.”
</p>

<p>
Nora sat speechless, with expanded eyes, hardly knowing
whether his humility or his audacity became him best;
flattered, above all, by what she deemed the recklessness
of his confidence.  She had removed her hat, which she
held in her hand, gently curling its great black feather.
Few things in a woman could be prettier than her
uncovered forehead, illumined with her gentle wonder.
The moment, for Hubert, was critical.  He knew that a
young girl’s heart stood trembling on the verge of his
influence; he felt, without fatuity, that a glance might
beckon her forward, a word might fix her there.  Should
he speak his word?  This mystic circle was haunted with
the rustling ghosts of women who had ventured within
and found no rest.  But as the innermost meaning of
Nora’s beauty grew vivid before him, it seemed to him
that she, at least, might cleanse it of its sinister
memories and fill it with the sense of peace.  He knew that
to such as Nora he was no dispenser of peace; but as
he looked at her she seemed to him as an angel knocking
at his gates.  He could not turn her away.  Let her
come, at her risk!  For angels there is a special
providence.  “Don’t think me worse than I am,” he said,
“but don’t think me better!  I shall love Roger well
until I begin to fancy that you love him too well.  Then,—it’s
absurd, perhaps, but I feel it will be so,—I shall
be jealous.”
</p>

<p>
The words were lightly uttered, but his eyes and voice
gave them meaning.  Nora colored and rose; she went
to the mirror and put on her hat.  Then turning round
with a laugh which, to one in the secret, might have
seemed to sound the coming-of-age of her maiden’s fancy,
“If you mean to be jealous,” she said, “now is your
time!  I love Roger now with all my heart.  I cannot
do more!”  She remained but a moment longer.
</p>

<p>
Roger’s illness baffled the doctors, though the doctors
were clever.  For a fortnight it went from bad to worse.
Nora remained constantly at home, and played but a passive
part to the little social drama enacted in Mrs. Keith’s
drawing-room.  This lady had already cleared her stage
and rung up her curtain.  To the temporary indisposition
of her young performer she resigned herself with that
serene good grace which she had always at command, and
which was so subtle an intermixture of kindness and
shrewdness that it would have taken a wiser head than
Nora’s to discriminate them.  She valued the young girl
for her social uses; but she spared her at this trying
hour, just as an impresario, with an eye to the whole
season, spares a prima donna who is threatened with
bronchitis.  Between these two, though there was little
natural sympathy, there was a wondrous exchange of
caresses and civilities.  They had quietly judged each
other and each sat serenely encamped in her estimate
as in a strategical position.  Nevertheless I would have
trusted neither lady’s account of the other.  Nora, for
perfect fairness, had too much to learn, and Mrs. Keith
too much to unlearn.  With her companion, however, she
had unlearned much of that circumspect jealousy with
which, in the interest of her remnant of youth and
beauty, she taxed her commerce with most of the
fashionable sisterhood.  She strove to repair her one
notable grievance against fate by treating Nora as a daughter.
She mused with real maternal ardor upon the young
girl’s matrimonial possibilities, and among them upon
that design of which Roger had dropped her a hint of
old.  He held to his purpose of course; if he had
fancied Nora then, he could but fancy her now.
</p>

<p>
But were his purpose and his fancy to be viewed with
undiminished complacency?  What might have been a
great prospect for Nora as a plain homeless child, was a
small prospect for a young lady who was turning out one
of the beauties of the day.  Roger would be the best of
husbands; but in Mrs. Keith’s philosophy a very good
husband might represent a very indifferent marriage.  She
herself had married a fool, but she had married well.
Her easy, opulent widowhood was there to show it.  To
call things by their names, would Nora, in marrying
Roger, marry money?  Mrs. Keith desired to appraise
the worldly goods of her rejected suitor.  At the time of
his suit she had the matter at her fingers’ ends; but she
suspected that since then he had been lining his pockets.
He puzzled her; he had a way of seeming neither rich
nor poor.  When he spent largely, he had the air of a
man straining a point; yet when he abstained, it seemed
rather from taste than from necessity.  She had been
surprised more than once, while abroad, by his copious
remittances to Nora.  The point was worth making sure
of.  The reader will agree with me that her conclusion
warranted her friend either a fool or a hero; for she
graciously assumed that if, financially, Roger should be found
wanting, she could easily prevail upon him to make way
for a millionnaire.  She had several millionnaires in her
eye.  Never was better evidence that Roger passed
for a good fellow.  In any event, however, Mrs. Keith
had no favor to spare for Hubert and his marked and
increasing “attentions.”  She had determined to beware
of false alarms; but meanwhile she was vigilant.  Hubert
presented himself daily with a report of his cousin’s
condition,—a report most minute and exhaustive,
seemingly, as a couple of hours were needed to make it.
Nora, moreover, went frequently to her friend’s house,
wandered about aimlessly, and talked with Lucinda; and
here Hubert, coming on the same errand, was sure to be
found or to find her.  Roger’s malady had defined itself
as virulent typhus fever; strength and reason were at the
lowest ebb.  Of course on these occasions Hubert walked
home with the young girl; and as the autumn weather
made walking delightful, they chose the longest way.
They might have been seen at this period perambulating
in deep discourse certain outlying regions, the
connection of which with the main line of travel between
Mrs. Keith’s abode and Roger’s was not immediately
obvious.  Apart from her prudent fears, Mrs. Keith had a
scantier kindness for Hubert than for most brilliant
men.  “What is he, when you come to the point?” she
impatiently demanded of a friend to whom she had
imparted her fears.  “He is neither fish nor flesh, neither
a priest nor a layman.  I like a clergyman to bring with
him a little odor of sanctity,—something that rests you,
after all your bother.  Nothing is so pleasant, near the
fire, at the sober end of one’s drawing-room.  If he
doesn’t fill a certain place, he is in the way.  The
Reverend Hubert is in any place and every place.  His
manners are neither of this world nor, I hope, of the next.
Last night he let me bring him a cup of tea and sat
lounging in his chair while I put it into his hand.  O, he
knows what he’s about.  He is pretentious, with all his
nonchalance.  He finds the prayer-book rather meagre
fare for week-days; so he consoles himself with his pretty
parishioners.  To be a parishioner, you needn’t go to his
church.”
</p>

<p>
But in spite of Mrs. Keith’s sceptical criticism, these
young persons played their game in their own way, with
wider moves, even, and heavier stakes, than their shrewd
hostess suspected.  As Nora, for the present, declined
all invitations, Mrs. Keith in the evening frequently went
out alone, leaving her in the drawing-room to entertain
Hubert Lawrence.  Roger’s illness furnished a grave
undercurrent to their talk and gave it a tone of hazardous
melancholy.  Nora’s young life had known no such hours
as these.  She hardly knew, perhaps, just what made them
what they were.  She hardly wished to know; she shrank
from breaking the charm with a question.  The scenes of
the past year had gathered into the background like a
huge distant landscape, glowing with color and swarming
with life; she seemed to stand with her friend in the
shadow of a passing cloud, looking off into the mighty
picture, caressing its fine outlines, and lingering where the
haze of regret lay purple in its hollows.  Hubert,
meanwhile, told over the legends of town and tower, of hill
and stream.  Never, she fondly fancied, had a young
couple conversed with less of narrow exclusiveness; they
took all history, all culture, into their confidence; the
radiant light of an immense horizon seemed to shine
between them.  Nora had felt perfectly satisfied; she
seemed to live equally in every need of her being, in soul
and sense, in heart and mind.  As for Hubert, he knew
nothing, for the time, save that the angel was within his
gates and must be treated to angelic fare.  He had for
the time the conscience, or the no-conscience, of a man
who is feasting in Elysian meadows.  He thought no
evil; he designed no harm; the hard face of destiny was
twisted into a smile.  If only, for Hubert’s sake, this
had been an irresponsible world, without penalties to pay,
without turnings to the longest lanes!  If the peaches
and plums in the garden of pleasure had no cheeks but
ripe ones, and if, when we have eaten the fruit, we had
not to dispose of the stones!  Nora’s charm of charms
was a certain maidenly reserve which Hubert both
longed and feared to abolish.  While it soothed his
conscience it irritated his ambition.  He wished to know in
what depth of water he stood; but there was no telltale
ripple in this tropic calm.  Was he drifting in mid-ocean,
or was he cruising idly among the sandy shallows?
As the days elapsed, he found his rest troubled by this
folded rose-leaf of doubt; for he was not used to being
baffled by feminine riddles.  He determined to pluck out
the heart of the mystery.
</p>

<p>
One evening, at Mrs. Keith’s urgent request, Nora had
prepared to go to the opera, as the season was to be very
brief.  Mrs. Keith was to dine with some friends and go
thither in their company; one of the ladies was to call
for Nora after dinner, and they were to join the party at
the theatre.  In the afternoon there came to Mrs. Keith’s
a young German lady, a pianist of merit who had her way
to make, a niece of Nora’s regular professor, with whom
Nora had an engagement to practise duets twice a week.
It so happened that, owing to a violent rain, Miss
Lilienthal had been unable to depart after their playing;
whereupon Nora had kept her to dinner, and the two,
over their sweetbread, had sworn an eternal friendship.
After dinner Nora went up to dress for the opera, and,
on descending, found Hubert sitting by the fire deep in
German discourse with the musical stranger.  “I was
afraid you would be going,” said Hubert: “I saw <i>Der
Freyschütz</i> on the placards.  Well, lots of pleasure!  Let
me stay here awhile and polish up my German with
Mademoiselle.  It is great fun.  And when the rain is
over, Fraülein, perhaps you’ll not mind my walking
home with you.”
</p>

<p>
But Mademoiselle was gazing in mute envy at Nora,
standing before her in festal array.  “She can take the
carriage,” said Nora, “when we have used it.”  And
then reading the burden of that wistful regard—“Have
you never heard <i>Der Freyschütz</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“Often!” said the other, with a poignant smile.
</p>

<p>
Nora reflected a moment, then drew off her gloves.
“You shall go, you shall take my place.  I will stay at
home.  Your dress will do; you shall wear my shawl.
Let me put this flower into your hair, and here are my
gloves and my fan.  So!  You are charming.  My gloves
are large,—never mind.  The others will be delighted
to have you; come to-morrow and tell me all about
it.”  Nora’s friend, in her carriage, was already at the door.
The gentle Fraülein, half shrinking, half eager, suffered
herself to be hurried down to the carriage.  On the
doorstep she turned and kissed her hostess with a fervent
“<i>Da allerliebste!</i>”  Hubert wondered whether Nora’s
purpose had been to please her friend or to please
herself.  Was it that she preferred his society to Weber’s
music?  He knew that she had a passion for Weber.
“You have lost the opera,” he said, when she
reappeared: “but let us have an opera of our own.  Play
something; play Weber.”  So she played Weber for
more than an hour; and I doubt whether, among the
singers who filled the theatre with their melody, the
master found that evening a truer interpreter than the young
girl playing in the lamp-lit parlor to the man she loved.
She played herself tired.  “You ought to be extremely
grateful,” she said, as she struck the last chord: “I have
never played so well.”
</p>

<p>
Later they came to speak of a novel which lay on the
table, and which Nora had been reading.  “It is very
silly,” she said, “but I go on with it in spite of myself.
I am afraid I am too easily pleased; no novel is so silly
I can’t read it.  I recommend you this, by the way.  The
hero is a young clergyman, endowed with every charm,
who falls in love with a Roman Catholic.  She is rather
a bigot, and though she loves the young man, she loves
her religion better.  To win his suit he comes near going
over to Rome; but he pulls up short and determines the
mountain shall come to Mahomet.  He sets bravely to
work, converts the young lady, baptizes her one week
and marries her the next.”
</p>

<p>
“Heaven preserve us, what a hotch-potch!” cried
Hubert.  “Is that what they are writing nowadays?  I
very seldom read a novel, but when I glance into one,
I am sure to find some such stuff as that!  Nothing
irritates me so as the flatness of people’s imagination.
Common life,—I don’t say it’s a vision of bliss, but it’s
better than that.  Their stories are like the underside of
a carpet,—nothing but the stringy grain of the tissue,—a
muddle of figures without shape and flowers without
color.  When I read a novel my imagination starts off
at a gallop and leaves the narrator hidden in a cloud of
dust; I have to come jogging twenty miles back to the
dénouement.  Your clergyman here with his Romish
sweetheart must be a very poor creature.  Why didn’t
he marry her first and convert her afterwards?  Isn’t a
clergyman after all, before all, a man?  I mean to write
a novel about a priest who falls in love with a pretty
Mahometan and swears by Allah to win her.”
</p>

<p>
“O Hubert!” cried Nora, “would you like a clergyman
to love a pretty Mahometan better than the truth?”
</p>

<p>
“The truth?  A pretty Mahometan may be the truth.
If you can get it in the concrete, after shivering all your
days in the cold abstract, it’s worth a bit of a
compromise.  Nora, Nora!” he went on, stretching himself
back on the sofa and flinging one arm over his head, “I
stand up for passion!  If a thing can take the shape of
passion, that’s a fact in its favor.  The greater passion
is the better cause.  If my love wrestles with my faith,
as the angel with Jacob, and if my love stands upper-most,
I will admit it’s a fair game.  Faith is faith, under
a hundred forms!  Upon my word, I should like to
prove it.  What a fraction of my personality is this clerical
title!  How little it expresses; how little it covers!
On Sundays, in the pulpit, I stand up and talk to five
hundred people.  Does each of them, think you,
appropriate his five hundredth share of my discourse?  I can
imagine talking to one person and saying five hundred
times as much, even though she were a pretty Mahometan
or a prepossessing idolatress!  I can imagine being
five thousand miles away from this blessed Boston,—in
Turkish trousers, if you please, with a turban on my head
and a chibouque in my mouth, with a great blue ball of
Eastern sky staring in through the round window, high
up; all in perfect indifference to the fact that Boston
was abusing, or, worse still, forgetting me!  But, my dear
Nora,” Hubert added, suddenly, “don’t let me introduce
confusion into your ideas.”  And he left his sofa and came
and leaned against the mantel-shelf.  “This is between
ourselves; I talk to you as I would to no one else.
Understand me and forgive me!  There are times when I must
speak out and pay my respects to the possible, the ideal!
I must protest against the vulgar assumption of people
who don’t see beyond their noses; that people who do,
you and I for instance, are living up to the top of our
capacity; that we are contented, satisfied, balanced.  I
promise you I am not satisfied, not I!  I have room for
more.  I only half live; I am like a purse filled at one
end with small coin and empty at the other.  Perhaps
the other will never know the golden rattle!  The Lord’s
will be done; I can say that with the best of them.  But
I shall never pretend that I have known happiness, that
I have known life.  On the contrary, I shall maintain I
am a failure.  I had the wit to see, but I lacked the
courage to do,—and yet I have been called reckless,
irreverent, audacious.  My dear Nora, I am the veriest
coward on earth; pity me, if you don’t despise me.
There are men born to imagine things, others born to
do them.  Evidently I am not one of the doers.  But I
imagine things, I assure you!”
</p>

<p>
Nora listened to this flow of sweet unreason without
staying her hand in the work, which, as she perceived
the drift of his talk, she had rapidly caught up, but with
a beating heart and a sense of rising tears.  It was a
ravishing mixture of passion and reason, the agony of
a restless soul.  Of old, she had thought of Hubert’s
nature as immutably placid and fixed; it gave her the
notion of lucid depth and soundless volume.  But of
late, with greater nearness, she had seen the ripples on
its surface and heard it beating its banks.  This was not
the first time; but the waves had never yet broken so
high; she had never felt their salt spray on her cheeks.
The touch of it now was delicious.  She went on with
her work, mechanically taking her stitches.  She felt
Hubert’s intense blue eyes; the little blue flower in
her tapestry grew under her quick needle.  A door had
suddenly been opened between their hearts; she passed
through it.  “What is it you imagine,” she asked, with
intense curiosity: “what is it you dream of doing?”
</p>

<p>
“I dream,” he said, “of breaking some law for your
sake!”
</p>

<p>
The answer frightened her; passion was outstripping
reason.  What had she to do with broken laws?  She
trembled and rolled up her work.  “I dream,” she said,
trying to smile, “of the beauty of keeping laws.  I
expect to get a deal of pleasure from it yet.”  And she
left her chair.  For an instant Hubert was confused.
Was this the last struggle which precedes submission, or
the mere prudence of indifference?  Nora’s eyes were on
the clock.  It rang out eleven.  “To begin with,” she
said, “let me keep the law of going early to bed.  Good
night!”
</p>

<p>
Hubert wondered; he hardly knew whether this was
a rebuke or a challenge.  “You will at least shake
hands,” he said reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
She had meant in self-defence to omit this ceremony,
but she let him take her hand.  Hubert gazed at her
a moment and raised it to his lips.  She blushed, and
rapidly withdrew it.  “There!” cried Hubert, “I have
broken a law!”
</p>

<p>
“Much good may it do you!” she answered, and
went her way.  He stood for a moment, waiting, and
fancying, rather fatuously, that she might come back.
Then, as he took up his hat, he wondered whether she
too was not a bit of a coquette.
</p>

<p>
Nora wondered on her own side whether this scene
had not been a little pre-arranged.  For a day love and
doubt fared in company.  Lucinda’s mournful discourse
on the morrow was not of a nature to restore her calmness.
“Last night,” said Roger’s nurse, “he was very bad.
He woke up out of his stupor, but he was none the better
for that.  He talked all night about you.  If he murmurs
a word, it’s always your name.  He asked a dozen
times if you had arrived, and forgot as often as I told
him,—he, dear man, who used to remember the very
hairs of your head.  He kept wondering whether anything
had happened to you.  Late in the evening, when
the carriages began to pass, he cried out that each of them
was you, and what would you think of him for not coming
to meet you?  ‘Don’t tell her how bad I am,’ he says;
‘I must have been in bed two or three days, haven’t I,
Lucinda?  Say I shall be out to-morrow; that I have
only a little cold.  Hubert will do everything for her,’ he
kept saying.  And then when, at midnight, the wind
began to blow, he declared it was a storm, that your ship
was on the coast.  God keep you safe, he cried.  Then
he asked if you were changed and grown; were you
pretty, were you tall, should he know you?  And he took
the hand-glass and looked at himself and wondered if you
would know him.  He cried out that he was ugly, he
was horrible, you would hate him.  He bade me bring
him his dressing things so that he might make himself look
better, and when I wouldn’t, he began to rage and call me
names, and then he broke down and cried like a child.”  Hearing
these things, Nora prayed intently for Roger’s
recovery,—prayed that he might live to see her more
cunningly and lovingly his debtor.  She wished to do
something, she hardly knew what, not only to prove, but
forever to commemorate, her devotion.  She felt capable
of erecting a monument of self-sacrifice.  Her conscience
was perfectly at rest.
</p>

<p>
For a couple of days she saw nothing of Hubert.  On
the third there came excellent news of Roger, who had
taken a marked turn for the better, and had passed the
crisis.  She had declined, for the evening, a certain
attractive invitation; but on the receipt of these tidings
she revoked her refusal.  Coming down to the drawing-room
with Mrs. Keith, dressed and shawled, she found
Hubert in waiting, with a face which uttered bad news.
Roger’s improvement had been momentary, a relapse had
followed, and he was worse than ever.  She tossed off
her shawl with an energy not unnoted by her duenna.
“Of course I cannot go,” she said.  “It is neither
possible nor proper.”  Mrs. Keith would have given her
biggest bracelet that this thing should not have happened in
just this way; but she submitted with a good grace,—for
a duenna.  Hubert went down with her to her carriage.
At the foot of the stairs she stopped, and while
gathering up her skirts, “Mr. Lawrence,” she demanded,
“are you going to remain here?”
</p>

<p>
“A little while,” said Hubert, with his imperturbable
smile.
</p>

<p>
“A very little while, I hope.”  She had been wondering
whether admonition would serve as a check or a
stimulus.  “I need hardly tell you that the young lady
up stairs is not a person to be trifled with.”
</p>

<p>
“I hardly know what you mean,” said Hubert.  “Am
I a person to trifle?”
</p>

<p>
“Is it serious, then?”
</p>

<p>
Hubert hesitated a moment.  She perceived a sudden
watchful quiver in his eye, like a sword turned edge
outward.  She unsheathed one of her own steely beams, and
for the tenth of a second there was a dainty crossing of
blades.  “I admire Miss Lambert,” cried Hubert, “with
all my heart.”
</p>

<p>
“True admiration,” said Mrs. Keith, “is one half
respect and the other half self-denial.”
</p>

<p>
Hubert laughed, ever so politely.  “I will put that
into a sermon,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“O, I have a sermon to preach you,” she answered.
“Take your hat and go.”
</p>

<p>
He looked very grave: “I will go up and get my
hat.”  Mrs. Keith, catching his eye as he closed the carriage
door, wished to Heaven that she had held her tongue.  “I
have done him injustice,” she murmured as she went.
“I have fancied him light, but I see he’s vicious.”  Hubert,
however, kept his promise in so far as that he did
take up his hat.  Having held it a moment he put it down.
He had reckoned without his hostess!  Nora was seated by
the fire, with her bare arms folded, with a downcast brow.
Dressed in pale corn-color, her white throat confined by
a band of blue velvet overstitched with a dozen pearls,
she was not a subject for summary farewells.  Meeting
her eyes, he saw they were filled with tears.  “You must
not take this thing too hard,” he said.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she answered nothing; then she bent
her face into her hands and her tears flowed.  “O poor,
poor Roger!” she cried.
</p>

<p>
Hubert watched her weeping in her ball-dress those
primitive tears.  “I have not given him up,” he said at
last.  “But suppose I had—”  She raised her head and
looked at him.  “O,” he cried, “I should have a hundred
things to say!  Both as a clergyman and as a man, I
should preach resignation.  In this crisis, let me speak
my mind.  Roger is part of your childhood; your childhood’s
at an end.  Possibly, with it he too is to go!  At
all events you are not to feel that in losing him you lose
everything.  I protest!  As you sit here he belongs to
your past.  Ask yourself what part he may play in your
future.  Believe me, you will have to settle it, you will
have to choose.  Here, in any case, <i>your</i> life begins.
Your tears are for the dead past; this is the future, with
its living needs.  Roger’s fate is only one of them.”
</p>

<p>
She rose with her tears replaced by a passionate gravity.
“Ah, you don’t know what you say!” she cried.  “Talk
of my future if you like, but not of my past!  No one
can speak of it, no one knows it!  Such as you see me
here, bedecked and bedizened, I am a penniless, homeless,
friendless creature!  But for Roger, I might be in
the streets!  Do you think I have forgotten it, that I ever
can forget it?  There are things that color one’s life,
memories that last forever.  I have my share!  What am I
to settle, between whom am I to choose?  My love for
Roger is no choice, it is part and parcel of my being!”
</p>

<p>
Hubert was inspired; he forgot everything but that she
was lovely.  “I wish to Heaven,” he cried, “that you
had never ceased to be penniless and friendless!  I wish
Roger had left you alone and not smothered you beneath
this terrible burden of gratitude!  Give him back his
gifts!  Take all <i>I</i> have!  In the streets?  In the streets
I should have found you, as lovely in your poverty as you
are now in your finery, and a thousand times more free!”  He
seized her hand and met her eyes with irresistible
ardor.  Pain and pleasure, at once, possessed Nora’s heart.
It was as if joy, bursting in, had trampled certain tender
flowers that bloomed on the threshold.  But Hubert had
cried, “I love you!  I love you!” and joy had taken
up the words.  She was unable to speak audibly; but in
an instant she was spared the effort.  The servant hastily
came in with a note superscribed with her name.  She
motioned to Hubert to open it.  He read it aloud.
“Mr. Lawrence is sinking.  You had better come.  I send my
carriage.”  Nora’s voice came to her with a cry,—“He
is dying, he is dying!”
</p>

<p>
In a minute’s time she found herself wrapped in her
shawl and seated with Hubert in the doctor’s coupé.  A
few moments more and the doctor received them at the
door of Roger’s room.  They passed in, and Nora went
straight to the bed.  Hubert stood an instant and saw her
drop on her knees beside the pillow.  She flung back her
shawl with vehemence, as if to release her arms; she
was throwing them round her friend.  Hubert went on
into the adjoining chamber, of which the door stood
open.  The room was dark, the other lit by a night-lamp.
He stood listening awhile, but heard nothing; then he
began to walk slowly to and fro, past the doorway.  He
could see nothing but the shining train of Nora’s dress
lying on the carpet beyond the angle of the bed.  He
wanted terribly to see more, but he feared to see too
much.  At moments he thought he heard whispers.  This
lasted some time; then the doctor came in, with what
seemed to him an odd, unprofessional smile.  “The
young lady knows a few remedies not taught in the
schools,” he whispered.  “He has recognized her.  He
is good for to-night, at least.  Half an hour ago he had
no pulse at all, but this has started it.  I will come back
in an hour.”  After he had gone Lucinda came, self-commissioned,
and shut the door in Hubert’s face.  He stood
a moment, with an unreasoned sense of insult and defeat.
Then he walked straight out of the house.  But the next
morning, after breakfast, a more generous sentiment
moved him to return.  The doctor was just coming away.
“It was a Daniel come to judgment,” the doctor
declared.  “I verily believe she saved him.  He will be
sitting up in a fortnight.”  Hubert learned that, having
achieved her miracle, Nora had returned to Mrs. Keith’s.
What arts she had used he was left to imagine.  He had
still a sore feeling of having just missed a crowning joy;
but there might yet be time to grasp it.  He felt, too, an
urgent need of catching a glimpse of the afterglow of
Nora’s mystical effluence.  He repaired to Mrs. Keith’s,
hoping to find the young girl alone.  But the elder lady,
as luck would have it, was established in the drawing-room,
and she made haste to inform him that Nora, fatigued
by her “watching,” had not yet left her room.  But
if Hubert was sombre, Mrs. Keith was radiant.  Now was
her chance to preach her promised sermon; she had just
come into possession of facts that furnished a capital text.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose you will call me a meddling busybody,”
she said.  “I confess I seem to myself a model of
forbearance.  Be so good as to tell me in three words
whether you are in love with Nora.”
</p>

<p>
Taken thus abruptly to task, Hubert, after a moment’s
trepidation, kept his balance.  He measured the situation
at a glance, and pronounced it bad.  But if heroic urbanity
would save it, he would be urbane.  “It is hardly a
question to answer in two words,” he answered, with an
ingenuous smile.  “I wish you could tell me!”
</p>

<p>
“Really,” said Mrs. Keith, “it seems to me that by
this time you might know.  Tell me at least whether you
are prepared to marry her?”
</p>

<p>
Hubert hesitated just an instant.  “Of course not,—so
long as I am not sure I am in love with her!”
</p>

<p>
“And pray when will you make up your mind?  And
what is to become of poor Nora meanwhile?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, Mrs. Keith, if Nora can wait, surely you can.”  The
urbanity need not be all on his side.
</p>

<p>
“Nora can wait?  That’s easily said.  Is a young
girl a thing to be tried like a piano,—to be strummed
on for a pretty tune?  O Mr. Lawrence, if I had ever
doubted of the selfishness of men!  What this matter has
been for you, you know best yourself; but I may tell
you that for Nora it has been serious.”  At these words
Hubert passed his hand nervously through his hair and
walked to the window.  “The miserable fop!” said Mrs. Keith,
privately.  “His vanity is the only thing that has
ears.  It is very true they are long ones!  If you are
not able to make Nora a handsome offer of marriage,” she
proceeded, “you have no business here.  Retire, quietly,
expeditiously, humbly.  Leave Nora to me.  I will heal
her bruises.  They shall have been wholesome ones.”
</p>

<p>
Hubert felt that these peremptory accents implied a
menace, and that the lady spoke by book.  His vanity
rankled, but discretion drew a long breath.  For a
fortnight it had been shut up in a closet.  He thanked his
stars they had no witnesses; from Mrs. Keith, for once,
he could afford to take a lesson.  He remained silent for
a moment, with his brow bent in meditation.  Then turning
suddenly, he faced the music.  “Mrs. Keith,” he
said, “you have done me a service.  I thank you
sincerely.  I have gone further than I meant; I admit it.
I am selfish, I am vain, I am anything you please.  My
only excuse is Nora’s loveliness.  It had made an ass of
me; I had forgotten that this is a life of logic.”  And he
bravely took up his hat.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith was prepared for a “scene”; she was
annoyed at missing it, and her easy triumph led her on.
She thought, too, of the young girl up stairs, combing
out her golden hair, and seeing no logic in her
looking-glass.  She had dragged a heavy gun to the front; she
determined to fire her shot.  So much virtue had never
inspired her with so little respect.  She played a moment
with the bow on her morning dress.  “Let me thank
you for your great humility,” she said.  “Do you know
I was going to be afraid of you, so that I had
intrenched myself behind a great big preposterous fact?
I met, last evening, Mrs. Chatterton of New York.  You
know she’s a great talker, but she talks to the point.
She mentioned your engagement to a certain young
lady, a dark-eyed person,—need I repeat the
name?”  There was no need of her repeating names; Hubert
stood before her, flushing crimson, with his blue eyes
flashing cold wrath.  He remained silent a moment,
shaking a scornful finger at her.  “For shame, madam,”
he cried.  “That’s in shocking taste!  You might have
been generous; it seems to me I deserve it.”  And with
a summary bow he departed.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith repented of this extra touch of zeal; the
more so as she found that, practically, Nora was to be
the victim of the young man’s displeasure.  For four
days he gave no sign; Nora was left to explain his
absence as she might.  Even Roger’s amendment failed to
console her.  At last, as the two ladies were sitting at
lunch, his card was brought in, superscribed <i>P.P.C.</i>
Nora read it in silence, and for a moment rested her
eyes on her companion with a piteous look which seemed
to ask, “Is it you I have to thank for this?”  A torrent
of remonstrances rose to Nora’s lips, but they were
sealed by the reflection that, though her friend might
have been concerned in Hubert’s desertion, its peculiar
abruptness had a peculiar motive.  She pretended to
occupy herself with her plate; but her self-control was
rapidly ebbing.  She silently rose and retreated to her
own room, leaving Mrs. Keith moralizing, over her
mutton-chop, upon the miseries of young-ladyhood and the
immeasurable egotism of the man who would rather
produce a cruel effect than none at all.  For a week after
this Nora was seriously ill.  On the day she left her room
she received a short note from Hubert.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter" style="text-align: right">
NEW YORK.
</p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR NORA: You have, I suppose, been expecting to
hear from me; but I have not written, because I am unable to
write as I wish and unwilling to write as—other people would
wish!  I left Boston suddenly, but not unadvisedly.  I shall
for the present be occupied here.  The last month I spent
there will remain one of the best memories of my life.  But it
was time it should end!  Remember me a little—what do I
say?—forget me!  Farewell.  I received this morning from
the doctor the best accounts of Roger.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Nora handled this letter somewhat as one may imagine
a pious maiden of the antique world to have treated a
messenger from the Delphic oracle.  It was obscure, it
was even sinister; but deep in its sacred dimness there
seemed to glow a fiery particle of truth.  She locked it up
in her dressing-case and wondered and waited.  Shortly
after came a missive of a different cast.  It was from her
cousin, George Fenton, and also dated New York.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR NORA,—You have left me to find out your return
in the papers.  I saw your name a month ago in the steamer’s
list.  But I hope the fine people and things you have been
seeing haven’t driven me quite out of your heart,—that you
remember at least who I am.  I received your answer to my
letter of last February; after which I immediately wrote again,
but in vain!  Perhaps you never got my letter; I could
scarcely decipher your Italian address.  Excuse my want of
learning!  Your photograph is a joy forever.  Are you really
as handsome as that?  It taxes even the credulity of one who
knows how pretty you used to be; how good you must be still.
When I last wrote I told you of my having taken stock in an
enterprise for working over refuse iron.  But what do you
care for refuse iron?  It’s awfully dirty, and not fit to be
talked of to a fine lady like you.  Still, if you have any odd
bits,—old keys, old nails,—the smallest contributions
thankfully received!  We think there is money in it; if there isn’t,
I’m afloat again.  If this fails, I think of going to Texas.  I
wish I might see you first.  Get Mr. Lawrence to bring you
to New York for a week.  I suppose it wouldn’t do for me to
call on you in the light of day; but I might hang round your
hotel and see you going in and out.  Does he love me as much
as ever, Mr. Lawrence?  Poor man, tell him to take it easy;
I shall never trouble him again.  Are you ever lonely in the
midst of your grandeur?  Do you ever feel that, after all, these
people are not of your blood and bone?  I should like you to
quarrel with them, to know a day’s friendlessness or a day’s
freedom, so that you might remember that here in New York, in a
dusty iron-yard, there is a poor devil who is your natural
protector.

<div class='chapter'><h2>VIII.</h2></div>

<p>
Roger’s convalescence went smoothly forward.
One morning as he lay coquetting deliciously
with returning sense, he became aware that a
woman was sitting at his window in the sun.  She seemed
to be reading.  He fancied vaguely that she was Lucinda;
but at last it occurred to him that Lucinda was not
addicted to literature, and that Lucinda’s tresses, catching
the light, were not of a kind to take on the likeness
of a queenly crown.  She was no vision; his visions had
been dark and troubled; and this image was radiant
and fixed.  He half closed his eyes and watched her
lazily through the lids.  There came to him, out of his
boyish past, a vague, delightful echo of the “Arabian
Nights.”  The room was gilded by the autumn sunshine
into the semblance of an enamelled harem court; he
himself seemed a languid Persian, lounging on musky
cushions; the fair woman at the window a Scheherazade, a
Badoura.  He closed his eyes completely and gave a
little groan, to see if she would move.  When he opened
them, she had moved; she stood near his bed, looking
at him.  For a moment his puzzled gaze still told him
nothing but that she was fictitiously fair.  She smiled
and smiled, and, after a little, as he only stared
confusedly, she blushed, not like Badoura or Scheherazade,
but like Nora.  Her frequent presence after this became
the great fact in his convalescence.  The thought of her
beauty filled the long empty hours during which he was
forbidden to do anything but grow strong.  Sometimes
he wondered whether his impression of it was only part of
the universal optimism of a man with a raging appetite.
Then he would question Lucinda, who would shake her
head and chuckle with elderly archness.  “Wait till you
are on your feet, sir, and judge for yourself,” she would
say.  “Go and call on her at Mrs. Keith’s, and then
tell me what you think.”  He grew well with a beating
heart; he would have stayed his recovery for the very
dread of facing his happiness.  But at last, one Sunday,
he discarded his dressing-gown and sat up, clothed and
in his right mind.  The effort, of course, gave him a huge
appetite, and he dealt vigorous justice upon his luncheon.
He had just finished, and his little table was still in
position near his arm-chair, when Nora made her appearance.
She had been to church, and on leaving church had taken
a long walk.  She wore one of those dark rich toilets of
early winter that are so becoming to fair beauties; but
her face lacked freshness; she was pale and tired.  On
Roger’s remarking it, she said the service had given her
a headache; as a remedy, she had marched off briskly
at haphazard, missed her way, and wandered hither and
thither.  But here she was, safe and sound and hungry.
She asked for a share of Roger’s luncheon, and, taking
off her bonnet, was bountifully served at his table.
She ate largely and hungrily, jesting at her appetite and
getting back her color.  Roger leaned back in his chair,
watching her, carving her partridge, offering her this and
that; in a word, falling in love.  It happened as naturally
as if he had never allowed for it.  The flower of her
beauty had bloomed in a night, that of his passion in a
day.  When at last she laid down her fork, and, sinking
back in her chair, folded her hands on her arms and sat
facing him with a friendly, pointless, satisfied smile, and
then, raising her goblet, threw back her head and showed
her white throat and glanced at him over the brim, while
he noted her plump ringless hand, with the little finger
curled out, he felt that he was in health again.  She
strolled about the room, idly touching the instruments on
his dressing-table and the odds and ends on his chimney-piece.
Her dress, which she had released from the loops
and festoons then in fashion, trailed rustling on the
carpet, and lent her a sumptuous, ladyish air which seemed
to give a price to this domiciliary visit.  “Everywhere,
everywhere, a little dust,” she said.  “I see it is more
than time I should be back here.  I have been waiting
for you to invite me; but as you don’t seem inclined, I
invite myself.”
</p>

<p>
Roger said nothing for a moment.  Then with a blush,
“I don’t mean to invite you; I don’t want you.”
</p>

<p>
Nora stared.  “Don’t want me?  <i>Par exemple!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“I want you as a visitor, but not as a—”  And he
fumbled for his word.
</p>

<p>
“As a resident?” She took it gayly.  “You turn
me out of doors?”
</p>

<p>
“No; I don’t take you in—yet awhile.  My dear
child, I have a reason.”
</p>

<p>
Nora wondered, still smiling.  “I might consider this
very unkind,” she said, “if I had not the patience of an
angel.  Would you kindly mention your reason?”
</p>

<p>
“Not now,” he answered.  “But never fear, when it
comes it will be all-sufficient!”  But he imparted it, a
couple of days after, to Mrs. Keith, who came late in the
afternoon to present her compliments on his recovery.
She displayed an almost sisterly graciousness, enhanced
by a lingering spice of coquetry; but somehow, as she
talked, he felt as if she were an old woman and he still
a young man.  It seemed a sort of hearsay that they
should ever have been mistress and lover.  “Nora will
have told you,” he said, “of my wishing you kindly to
keep her awhile longer.  I can give you no better proof
of my regard, for the fact is, my dear friend, I am in love
with her.”
</p>

<p>
“Come!” she cried.  “This is interesting.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish her to accept me freely, as she would accept
any other man.  For that purpose I must cease to be, in
all personal matters, her guardian.”
</p>

<p>
“She must herself forget her wardship, if there is to
be any sentimentalizing between you,—all but forget it,
at least.  Let me speak frankly,” she went on.  Whereupon
Roger frowned a bit, for he had known her frankness
to be somewhat incisive.  “It is all very well that
you should be in love with her.  You are not the first.
Don’t be frightened; your chance is fair.  The needful
point is that she should be just the least bit in love with
you.”
</p>

<p>
He shook his head with melancholy modesty.  “I don’t
expect that.  She loves me a little, I hope; but I say
nothing to her imagination.  Circumstances are fatally
against it.  If she falls in love, it will be with a man as
unlike me as possible.  Nevertheless, I do hope she may,
without pain, learn to think of me as a husband.  I hope,”
he cried, with appealing eyes, “that she may see a certain
rough propriety in it.  After all, who can make her
such a husband as I?  I am neither handsome, nor clever,
nor accomplished, nor celebrated.  She might choose from
a dozen men who are.  Pretty lovers doubtless they would
make; but, my friend, it’s the <i>husband</i>, the husband, that
is the test!”  And he beat his clenched hand on his
knee.  “Do they know her, have they watched her, as I
have done?  What are their months to my years, their
vows to my acts?  Mrs. Keith!”—and he grasped her
hand as if to call her to witness,—“I undertake to make
her happy.  I know what you can say,—that a woman’s
happiness is worth nothing unless imagination lends a
hand.  Well, even as a lover, perhaps I am not a hopeless
case!  And then, I confess, other things being equal,
I would rather Nora should not marry a poor man.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith spoke, on this hint.  “You are a rich one,
then?”
</p>

<p>
Roger folded up his pocket-handkerchief and patted it
out on his knee, with pregnant hesitation.  “Yes, I am
rich,—I may call it so.  I am rich!” he repeated with
unction.  “I can say it at last.”  He paused a moment,
and then, with unstudied irony,—“I was not altogether
a pauper when you refused me.  Since then, for
the last six years, I have been saving and sparing and
counting.  My purpose has sharpened my wits, and fortune,
too, has favored me.  I have speculated a little, I
have handled stock and turned this and that about, and
now I can offer my wife a very pretty fortune.  It has
been going on very quietly; people don’t know it; but
Nora, if she cares to, shall show them!”  Mrs. Keith
colored and mused; she was lost in a tardy afterthought.
“It seems odd to be talking to you this way,” Roger
went on, exhilarated by this summing-up of his career.
“Do you remember that letter of mine from P——?”
</p>

<p>
“I did not tear it up in a rage,” she answered.  “I
came across it the other day.”
</p>

<p>
“It was rather odd, my writing it, you know,” Roger
confessed.  “But in my sudden desire to register a vow,
I needed a friend.  I turned to you as my best
friend.”  Mrs. Keith acknowledged the honor with a toss of her
head.  Had she made a mistake of old?  She very soon
decided that Nora should not repeat it.  Her hand-shake,
as she left her friend, was generous; it seemed to assure
him that he might count upon her.
</p>

<p>
When, soon after, he made his appearance in her
drawing-room, she gave him many a hint as to how to play his
cards.  But he irritated her by his slowness; he was too
circumspect by half.  It was only in the evening that he
took a hand in the game.  During the day he left Nora
to her own affairs, and was in general neither more nor
less attentive than if he had been a merely susceptible
stranger.  To spectators his present relation with the
young girl was somewhat puzzling; though Mrs. Keith,
by no ambiguous giving out, as Hamlet says, had diffused
a sympathetic expectancy.  Roger wondered again and
again whether Nora had guessed his meaning.  He observed
in her at times, as he fancied, a sort of nervous
levity which seemed born of a need to conjure away the
phantom of sentiment.  And of this hostile need, of course,
he hereupon strove to trace the lineage.  He talked with
her little, as yet, and never interfered in her talk with
others; but he watched her devotedly from corners, and
caught her words through the hum of voices.  Sometimes
she looked at him as if she were on the point of telling
him something.  What had she to tell him?  In trying
to guess, Roger made up his mind that she was in love.
Search as he could, however, he was unable to find her
lover.  It was no one there present; they were all alike
wasting their shot; the enemy had stolen a march and
was hidden in the very heart of the citadel.  He appealed
distractedly to Mrs. Keith.  “Lovesick,—lovesick is the
word,” he groaned.  “I have read of it all my days in
the poets, but here it is in the flesh.  The poor girl plays
her part well; she’s wound up tight; but the spring
will snap and the watch run down.  D—n the man!
I would rather he carried her off than sit and see
this.”  He saw that his friend had bad news.  “Tell me
everything,” he said: “don’t spare me.”
</p>

<p>
“You have noticed it at last,” she answered.  “I was
afraid you would.  Well! he’s not far to seek.  Think
it over; can’t you guess?  My dear Mr. Lawrence, you
are celestially simple.  Your cousin Hubert is not.”
</p>

<p>
“Hubert!” Roger echoed, staring.  A spasm passed
over his face; his eyes flashed.  At last he hung his head.
“Dear, dear,” he said: “have I done it all for Hubert?”
</p>

<p>
“Not if I can help it!” cried Mrs. Keith, sharply.
“She may not marry you; but, at the worst, she shall
not marry him!”
</p>

<p>
Roger laid his hand on her arm; first heavily, then
gently.  “Dear friend, she must be happy, at any cost.
If she loves Hubert, she must marry him.  I will settle
an income!”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith gave his knuckles a great rap with her fan.
“You will settle a fiddlestick!  You will keep your
money and you will marry Miss Nora.  Leave it to me!
If you have no regard for your rights, at least I have.”
</p>

<p>
“Rights? what rights have I?  I might have let her
alone.  I needn’t have settled down on her in this deadly
fashion.  But Hubert’s a happy man!  Does he know
it?  You must write to him.  I can’t!”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith burst into a ringing laugh.  “Know it?
You are amazing!  Hadn’t I better telegraph?”
</p>

<p>
Roger stared and frowned.  “Does he suspect it, then?”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith rolled up her eyes.  “Come,” she said,
“we must begin at the beginning.  When you speak of
your cousin, you open up a gulf.  There is not much in
it, it’s true; but it’s a gulf.  Your cousin is a
humbug,—neither more nor less.  Allow me; I know what I
say.  He knew, of course, of your plans for Nora!”  Roger
nodded.  “Of course he did!  He took his
chance, therefore, while you were well out of the way.
He lost no time, and if Nora is in love with him, he can
tell you why.  He knew that he could not marry her,
that he should not, that he would not.  But he made love
to her, to pass the time.  Happily, it passed soon.  I had
of course to be cautious; but as soon as I saw how things
were going, I spoke, and spoke to the point.  Though
he’s a humbug, he is not a fool; that was all he needed.
He made his excuses, such as they were!  I shall know
in future what to think of him.”
</p>

<p>
Roger shook his head mournfully.  “I am afraid it’s
not to be so easily settled.  As you say, Hubert’s a gulf.
I never sounded it.  The fact remains that they love each
other.  It’s hard, but it’s fatal.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith lost patience.  “Don’t try the heroic; you
will break down,” she cried.  “You are the best of men,
but after all you are human.  To begin with, Hubert
doesn’t love her.  He loves no one but himself.  Nora
must find her happiness where women as good have
found it before this, in a sound, sensible marriage.  She
cannot marry Hubert; he is engaged to another person.
Yes, I have the facts; a young girl in New York with
whom he has been off and on for a couple of years, but
who holds him to his bargain.  I wish her joy of it!
He is not to be pitied; she is not Nora, but she is
extremely fond of him, and she is to have money.  So
good by to Hubert.  As for you, cut the knot!  She’s
a bit sentimental just now; but one sentiment, at that
age, is as good as another.  And, my dear man, the girl
has a conscience, it’s to be hoped; give her a chance
to show it.  A word to the wise!”
</p>

<p>
Thus exhorted, Roger determined to act.  The next
day was a Sunday.  While the ladies were at church he
took up his position in their drawing-room.  Nora came
in alone; Mrs. Keith had made a pretext for ascending
to her own room, where she waited with some solemnity.
“I am glad to find you,” Nora said.  “I have been
wanting particularly to speak to you.  Is my probation
not over?  May not I now come back?”
</p>

<p>
“It’s about that,” he answered, “that I came to talk
to you.  The probation has been mine.  Has it lasted
long enough?  Do you love me yet?  Come back to
me,—come back to me as my wife.”
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, as he spoke, with a clear, unfrightened
gaze, and, with his last words, broke frankly into a
laugh.  But as his own face was intensely grave, a
gradual blush arrested her laugh.  “Your wife, Roger?” she
asked gently.
</p>

<p>
“My wife.  I offer you my hand.  Dear Nora, is it so
incredible?”
</p>

<p>
To his uttermost meaning, somehow, her ear was still
closed; she still took it as a jest.  “Is that the only
condition on which we can live together?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“The only one,—for me!”
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, still sounding his eyes with her
own.  But his passion, merciful still, retreated before her
frank doubt.  “Ah,” she said, smiling, “what a pity I
have grown up!”
</p>

<p>
“Well,” he said, “since you are grown we must make
the best of it.  Think of it, Nora, think of it.  I am
not so old, you know.  I was young when we began.
You know me so well; you would be safe.  It would
simplify matters vastly; it’s at least worth thinking of,”
he went on, pleading for very tenderness, in this pitiful
minor key.  “I know it must seem odd; but I make
you the offer!”
</p>

<p>
Nora was almost shocked.  In this strange new character
of a lover she seemed to see him eclipsed as a friend,
now when, in the trouble of her love, she turned longingly
to friendship.  She was silent awhile, with her
embarrassment.  “Dear Roger,” she answered, at last, “let
me love you in the old, old way.  Why need we change?
Nothing is so good, so safe as that.  I thank you from
my heart for your offer.  You have given me too much
already.  Marry any woman you please, and I will be her
serving-maid.”
</p>

<p>
He had no heart to meet her eyes; he had wrought his
own fate.  Mechanically, he took up his hat and turned
away, without speaking.  She looked at him an instant,
uncertain, and then, loath to part with him so abruptly,
she laid her arm round his neck.  “You don’t think me
unkind?” she said.  “I will do anything for you on
earth”—<i>But that</i> was unspoken, yet Roger heard it.
The dream of years was shattered; he felt sick; he was
dumb.  “You forgive me?” she went on.  “O Roger,
Roger!” and, with a strange inconsequence of lovingness,
she dropped her head on his shoulder.  He held her
for a moment as close as he had held his hope, and then
released her as suddenly as he had parted with it.  Before
she knew it, he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Nora drew a long breath.  It had all come and gone
so fast that she was bewildered.  It had been what she
had heard called a “chance.”  Suppose she had grasped
at it?  She felt a kind of relief in the thought that she
had been wise.  That she had been cruel, she never
suspected.  She watched Roger, from the window, cross the
street and take his way up the sunny slope.  Two ladies
passed him, friends, as Nora saw; but he made no bow.
Suddenly Nora’s reflections deepened and the scene
became portentous.  If she had been wrong, she had been
horribly wrong.  She hardly dared to think of it.  She
ascended to her own room, to take counsel of familiar
privacy.  In the hall, as she passed, she found Mrs. Keith
at her open door.  This lady put her arm round her waist,
led her into the chamber toward the light.  “Something
has happened,” she said, looking at her curiously.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I have had an offer of marriage.  From Roger.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, well?”  Mrs. Keith was puzzled by her face.
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it kind of him?  To think he should have
thought it necessary!  It was soon settled.”
</p>

<p>
“Settled, dearest?  How?”
</p>

<p>
“Why—why—”  And Nora began to smile the
more resolutely, as her imagination had taken alarm.
“I declined.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith released her with a gesture almost
tragical.  “Declined?  Unhappy girl!”  The words were
charged with a righteous indignation so unusual to the
speaker that Nora’s conscience took the hint.
</p>

<p>
She turned very pale.  “What have I done?” she
asked, appealingly.
</p>

<p>
“Done, my dear?  You have done a blind, cruel act!
Look here.”  And Mrs. Keith having hastily ransacked
a drawer, turned about with an open letter.  “Read that
and repent.”
</p>

<p>
Nora took the letter; it was old and crumpled, the
ink faded.  She glanced at the date,—that of her first
school year.  In a moment she had read to the closing
sentence.  “It will be my own fault if I have not a
perfect wife.”  In a moment more its heavy meaning
overwhelmed her; its vital spark flashed back over the
interval of years.  She seemed to see Roger’s bent, stunned
head in the street.  Mrs. Keith was frightened at her
work.  Nora dropped the letter and stood staring,
open-mouthed, pale as death, with her poor young face blank
with horror.
</p>

<div class='chapter'><h2>IX.</h2></div>

<p>
Nora frequently wondered in after years how that
Sunday afternoon had worked itself away; how,
through the tumult of amazement and grief, decision,
illumination, action, had finally come.  She had
disembarrassed herself of a vague attempt of Mrs. Keith’s
towards some compensatory caress, and making her way
half blindly to her own room, had sat down face to face
with her trouble.  Here, if ever, was thunder from a
clear sky.  Her friend’s disclosure took time to swell to
its full magnitude; for an hour she sat, half stunned,
seeming to see it climb heaven-high and glare upon her
like some monstrous blighting sun.  Then at last she
broke into a cry and wept.  Her immense pain gushed
and filtered through her heart, and passed out in
shuddering sobs.  The whole face of things was hideously
altered; a sudden horror had sprung up in her innocent
past, and it seemed to fling forward a shadow which
made the future a blank darkness.  She felt cruelly
deluded and injured; the sense of suffered wrong absorbed
for the time the thought of wrong inflicted.  She was too
weak for indignation, but she overflowed with delicate
resentment.  That Roger, whom all these years she had
fancied as simple as charity, should have been as double
as interest, should have played a part and laid a train,
that she had been living in darkness, on illusion and lies,
all this was an intolerable thing.  And the worst was
that she had been cheated of the chance to be really loyal.
Why had he never told her that she wore a chain?
Why, when he took her, had he not drawn up his terms
and made his bargain?  She would have kept the bargain
to the letter; she would have taught herself to be
his wife.  Duty then would have been duty; sentiment
would have been sentiment; her youth would not have
been so wretchedly misspent.  She would have given up
her heart betimes; doubtless it would have learned to
beat to a decent and satisfied measure; but now it had
throbbed to a finer music, a melody that would ring in
her ears forever.  Thinking of what her conscience might
have done, however, brought her to thinking of what it
might still do.  While she turned in her pain, angrily
questioning it, Mrs. Keith knocked at the door.  Nora
repaired to the dressing-glass, to efface the traces of her
tears; and while she stood there, she saw in her open
dressing-case her last letter from her cousin.  It gave
her the help she was vaguely groping for.  By the time
she had crossed the room and opened the door she had
welcomed and blessed this help; and while she gravely
shook her head in response to Mrs. Keith’s softly urgent,
“Nora, dear, won’t you let me come to you?” she had
passionately made it her own.  “I would rather be
alone,” she said: “I thank you very much.”
</p>

<p>
It was past six o’clock; Mrs. Keith was dressed for
the evening.  It was her gracious practice on Sundays to
dine with her mother-in-law.  Nora knew, therefore, that
if her companion accepted this present dismissal, she
would be alone for several hours.
</p>

<p>
“Can’t I do something for you?” Mrs. Keith inquired,
soothingly.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing at all, thank you.  You are very kind.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith looked at her, wondering whether this was
the irony of bitter grief; but a certain cold calmness in
the young girl’s face, overlying her agitation, seemed to
intimate that she had taken a wise resolve.  And, in fact,
Nora was now soaring sublime on the wings of purpose,
and viewed Mrs. Keith’s offence as a diminished fact.
Mrs. Keith took her hands.  “Write him a line, my
dear,” she gently urged.
</p>

<p>
Nora nodded.  “Yes, I will write him a line.”
</p>

<p>
“And when I come back, it will be all over?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,—all over.”
</p>

<p>
“God bless you, my dear.”  And on this theological
amenity the two women kissed and separated.  Nora
returned to her dressing-case and read over her cousin’s
letter.  Its clear friendliness seemed to ring out audibly
amid this appalling hush of familiar harmony.  “I wish
you might know a day’s friendliness or a day’s freedom,—a
poor devil who is your natural protector.”  Here was
indeed the voice of nature, of predestined tenderness; if
her cousin had been there Nora would have flung herself
into his arms.  She sat down at her writing-table, with
her brow in her hands, light-headed with her passionate
purpose, steadying herself to think.  A day’s freedom
had come at last; a lifetime’s freedom confronted her.
For, as you will have guessed, immediate retrocession
and departure had imperiously prescribed themselves.
Until this had taken place, there could be nothing but
deeper trouble.  On the old terms there could be no
clearing up; she could speak to Roger again only in
perfect independence.  She must throw off those suffocating
bounties which had been meant to bribe her to the service
in which she had so miserably failed.  Her failure now
she felt no impulse to question, her decision no energy
to revise.  I shall have told my story ill if these things
seem to lack logic.  The fault lay deeper and dated from
longer ago than her morning’s words of denial.  Roger
and she shared it between them; it was a heavy burden
for both.
</p>

<p>
She wrote her “line,” as she had promised Mrs. Keith,
rapidly, without erasure; then wrote another to
Mrs. Keith, folded and directed them and laid them on her
dressing-table.  She remembered now, distinctly, that she
had heard of a Sunday-evening train to New York.  She
hastened down stairs, found in a newspaper the railway
advertisement, and learned that the train started at eight;
satisfied herself, too, that the coast was clear of servants,
and that she might depart unquestioned.  She bade a
gleeful farewell to her borrowed possessions,—unearned
wages, ineffective lures.  She exchanged the dress she
had worn to church for an old black silk one, put a few
articles of the first necessity into a small travelling-bag,
and emptied her purse of all save a few dollars.  Then
bonneted, shawled, veiled, with her bag in her hand, she
went forth into the street.  She would begin as she would
have to proceed; she started for the station, savingly, on
foot.  Happily it was not far off; she reached it through
the wintry darkness, out of breath, but in safety.  She
seemed to feel about her, as she went, the old Bohemianism
of her childhood; she was once more her father’s
daughter.  She bought her ticket and found a seat in the
train without adventure; with a sort of shame, in fact,
that this great deed of hers should be so easy to do.  But
as the train rattled hideously through the long wakeful
hours of the night, difficulties came thickly; in the mere
oppression of her conscious purpose, in the keener vision
at moments of Roger’s distress, in a vague dread of the
great unknown into which she was rushing.  But she
could do no other,—no other; with this refrain she
lulled her doubts.  It was strange how, as the night
elapsed and her heart-beats seemed to keep time to the
crashing swing of the train, her pity for Roger increased.
It would have been an immense relief to be able to hate
him.  Her undiminished affection, forced back upon her
heart, swelled and rankled there tormentingly.  But if
she was unable to hate Roger, she could at least abuse
herself.  Every circumstance of the last six years, in this
new light, seemed to have taken on a vivid meaning,—a
meaning that made a sort of crime of her own want of
foreknowledge.  She kept thinking of expiation, and
determined she would write to Miss Murray, her former
schoolmistress, and beg that she might come and teach
little girls their scales.  She kept her cousin’s letter
clinched in her hand; but even when she was not thinking
of Roger she was not always thinking of Fenton.  She
could tell Hubert Lawrence now that she was as poor and
friendless as he had ever wished he could see her.
</p>

<p>
Toward morning she fell asleep for weariness.  She
was roused by a great tumult and the stopping of the
train, which had arrived.  She found with dismay that,
as it was but seven o’clock, she had two or three hours
on her hands.  George would hardly be at his place of
business before ten, and the interval seemed formidable.
The dusk of a winter’s morning lingered still, and
increased her trouble.  But she followed her companions
and stood in the street.  Half a dozen hackmen attacked
her; a facetious gentleman, lighting a cigar, asked her if
she wouldn’t take a carriage with him.
</p>

<p>
She made her escape from the bustle and hurried along
the street, praying to be unnoticed.  She told herself
sternly that now her difficulties had begun and must be
bravely faced; but as she stood at the street-corner,
beneath an unextinguished lamp, listening to the nascent
hum of the town, she felt a most unreasoned sinking of
the heart.  A Dutch grocer, behind her, was beginning
to open his shop; an ash-barrel stood beside her, and
while she lingered an old woman with a filthy bag on her
back came and poked in it with a stick; a policeman,
muffled in a comforter, came lounging squarely along the
pavement and took her slender measure with his hard
official eye.  What a hideous, sordid world!  She was
afraid to do anything but walk and walk.  Fortunately,
in New York, in the upper region, it is impossible to lose
one’s way; and she knew that by keeping downward and
to the right she should reach her appointed refuge.  The
streets looked shabby and of ill-repute; the houses seemed
mean and sinister.  When, to fill her time, she stopped
before the window of some small shop, the objects within
seemed, in their ugliness, to mock at her unnatural
refinement.  She must give that up.  At last she began to
feel faint and hungry, for she had fasted since the previous
morning.  She ventured into an establishment which had
<i>Ladies’ Café</i> inscribed in gilt letters on a blue tablet in
the window, and justified its title by an exhibition of stale
pies and fly-blown festoons of tissue-paper.  On her
request, humbly preferred, for a cup of tea, she was served
staringly and condescendingly by a half-dressed young
woman, with frowzy hair and tumid eyes.  The tea was
bad, yet Nora swallowed it, not to complicate the situation.
The young woman had come and sat down at her table,
handled her travelling-bag, and asked a number of plain
questions; among others, if she wouldn’t like to go up
and lie down.  “I guess it’s a dollar,” said this person,
to conclude her achievements, alluding to the cup of tea.
Nora came afterwards to a square, in which was an
enclosure containing trees, a frozen fountain, thawing fast,
and benches.  She went in and sat down on one of the
benches.  Several of the others were occupied by shabby
men, sullen with fasting, with their hands thrust deep into
their pockets, swinging their feet for warmth.  She felt
a faint fellowship in their grim idleness; but the fact that
they were all men and she the only woman, seemed to
open out deeper depths in her loneliness.  At last, when
it was nine o’clock, she made her way to Tenth Avenue
and to George’s address.  It was a neighborhood of
storehouses and lumber-yards, of wholesale traffic in articles
she had never heard of, and of multitudinous carts, drawn
up along the pavement.  She found a large cheap-looking
sign in black and white,—<i>Franks and Fenton</i>.  Beneath
it was an alley, and at the end of this alley a small office
which seemed to communicate with an extension of the
precinct in the rear.  The office was open; a small ragged
boy was sweeping it with a broom.  From him she learned
that neither Franks nor Fenton had arrived, but that if
she wanted, she might come in and wait.  She sat down
in a corner, tremulous with conjecture, and scanned the
room, trying to bridge over this dull interval with some
palpable memento of her cousin.  But the desk, the stove,
the iron safe, the chairs, the sordid ink-spotted walls,
were as blank and impersonal as so many columns of
figures.  When at last the door opened and a man appeared,
it was not Fenton, but, presumably, Franks.  Mr. Franks
was a small meagre man, with a whitish coloring, weak
blue eyes and thin yellow whiskers, suffering apparently
from some nervous malady.  He nodded, he stumbled, he
jerked his arms and legs about with pitiful comicality.
He had a huge protuberant forehead, such a forehead as
would have done honor to a Goethe or a Newton; but
poor Mr. Franks must have been at best a man of latent
genius.  Superficially he was a very witless person.  He
informed Nora, on learning her errand, that his partner
(“pardner,” he called it) was gone to Williamsburg
on business, and would not return till noon; meanwhile,
was it anything <i>he</i> could do?  Nora’s heart sank at this
vision of comfort still deferred; but she thanked
Mr. Franks, and begged leave to sit in her corner and wait.
Her presence seemed to redouble his agitation; she
remained for an hour gazing in painful fascination at his
unnatural shrugs and spasms, as he busied himself at his
desk.  The Muse of accounts, for poor Mr. Franks, was,
in fact, not habitually a young woman, thrice beautiful
with trouble, sitting so sensibly at his elbow.  Nora
wondered how George had come to choose so foolish an
associate; then she guessed that it was his want of capital
that had discovered a secret affinity with Mr. Franks’s
want of brains.  The merciless intensity of thought
begotten by her excitement suggested that there was
something dishonorable in this connection.  From time to time
Mr. Franks wheeled about in his chair and fixed her solemnly
with his pallid glance, as if to offer her the privilege
of telling him her story; and on her failure to avail
herself of it, turned back to his ledger with a little grunt of
injury and a renewal of his grotesque agitation.  As
the morning wore away, various gentlemen of the kind
designated as “parties” came in and demanded Fenton,
in a tone that made the smallest possible account of
Mr. Franks.  Several of them sat awhile on tilted chairs,
chewing their toothpicks, stroking their beards, and
listening with a half-bored grin to what appeared to be an
intensely confidential exposition of Mr. Franks’s wrongs.
One of them, as he departed, gave Nora a wink, as if to
imply that the state of affairs between the two members
of the firm was so broad a joke that even a pretty young
woman might enjoy it.  At last, when they had been alone
again for half an hour, Mr. Franks closed with a slap the
great leathern flanks of his account-book, and sat a moment
burying his head in his arms.  Then he suddenly rose and
stood before the young girl.  “Mr. Fenton’s your cousin,
Miss, you say, eh?  Well, then, let me tell you that your
cousin’s a swindler!  I can prove it to you on those
books!  Nice books they are!  Where is my money,
thirty thousand dollars that I put into this d——d
humbug of a business?  What is there to show for it?  I have
been made a fool of,—as if I wasn’t fool enough already.”  The
tears stood in his eyes, he stamped with the bitterness
of his spite; and then, thrusting his hat on his head
and giving Nora’s amazement no time to reply, he darted
out of the door and went up the alley.  Nora saw him
from the window, looking up and down the street.
Suddenly, while he stood and while she looked, George came
up.  Mr. Franks’s fury seemed suddenly to evaporate;
he received his companion’s hand-shake and nodded toward
the office, as if to tell of Nora’s being there; while,
to her surprise, George hereupon, without looking toward
the window, turned back into the street.  In a few
minutes, however, he reappeared alone, and in another
moment he stood before her.  “Well!” he cried: “here
you are, then!”
</p>

<p>
“George,” she said, “I have taken you at your word.”
</p>

<p>
“My word?  O yes!” cried George, bravely.
</p>

<p>
She saw that he was changed, and not for the better.
He looked older, he was better dressed and more
prosperous; but as Nora looked at him, she felt that she had
asked too much of her imagination.  He eyed her from
head to foot, and in a moment he had noted her simple
dress and her pale face.  “What on earth has
happened?” he asked, closing the door with a kick.
</p>

<p>
Nora hesitated, feeling that, with words, tears might
come.
</p>

<p>
“You are sick,” he said, “or you are going to be
sick.”
</p>

<p>
This horrible idea helped her to recall her self-control.
“I have left Mr. Lawrence,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“So I see!” said George, wavering between relish
and disapproval.  When, a few moments before, his
partner had told him that a young lady was in the office,
calling herself his cousin, he had straightway placed
himself on his guard.  The case was delicate; so that,
instead of immediately advancing, he had retreated
behind a green baize door twenty yards off, had “taken
something,” and briskly meditated.  She had taken him
at his word; he knew that before she told him.  But
confound his word if it came to this!  It had been meant,
not as an invitation to put herself under his care, but as
a kind of speculative “feeler.”  Fenton, however, had
a native sympathy with positive measures; and he felt,
moreover, the instinct to angle in Nora’s troubled
waters.  “What’s the matter now?” he asked.  “Have
you quarrelled?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t call it a quarrel, George!  He is as kind, he
is kinder than ever,” Nora cried.  “But what do you
think?  He has asked me to marry him.”
</p>

<p>
“Eh, my dear, I told you he would.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t believe you.  I ought to have believed you.
But it is not only that.  It is that, years ago, he adopted
me with that view.  He brought me up for that purpose.
He has done everything for me on that condition.  I was
to pay my debt and be his wife.  I never dreamed of it.
And now at last that I have grown up and he makes his
claim, I can’t, I can’t!”
</p>

<p>
“You can’t, eh?  So you have left him!”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I have left him.  It was the only thing to
do.  It was give and take.  I cannot give what he wants,
and I cannot give back what I have received.  But I
can refuse to take more.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton sat on the edge of his desk, swinging his leg.
He folded his arms and whistled a lively air, looking at
Nora with a brightened eye.  “I see, I see,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Telling her tale had deepened her color and added to
her beauty.  “So here I am,” she went on.  “I know
that I am dreadfully alone, that I am homeless and
helpless.  But it’s a heaven to living as I have lived.  I
have been content all these days, because I thought I
could content him.  But we never understood each other.
He has given me immeasurable happiness; I know that;
and he knows that I know it; don’t you think he knows,
George?” she cried, eager even in her reserve.  “I
would have made him a sister, a friend.  But I don’t
expect you to understand all this.  It’s enough that I
am satisfied.  I am satisfied,” the poor girl repeated
vehemently.  “I have no illusions about it now; you can
trust me, George.  I mean to earn my own living.  I
can teach; I am a good musician; I want above all
things to work.  I shall look for some employment without
delay.  All this time I might have been writing to Miss
Murray.  But I was sick with impatience to see you.
To come to you was the only thing I could do; but I
shall not trouble you for long.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton seemed to have but half caught the meaning of
this impassioned statement, for simple admiration of her
exquisite purity of purpose was fast getting the better of
his caution.  He gave his knee a loud slap.  “Nora,”
he said, “you’re a wonderful young lady!”
</p>

<p>
For a moment she was silent and thoughtful.  “For
mercy’s sake,” she cried at last, “say nothing to make
me feel that I have done this thing too easily, too proudly
and recklessly!  Really, I am anything but brave.  I am
full of doubts and fears.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re uncommonly handsome; that’s one sure
thing!” said Fenton.  “I would rather marry you than lose
you.  Poor Mr. Lawrence!”  Nora turned away in silence
and walked to the window, which grew to her eyes, for
the moment, as the “glimmering square” of the poet.
“I thought you loved him so!” he added, abruptly.
Nora turned back with an effort and a blush.  “If he
were to come to you now,” he went on, “and go down
on his knees and beg and plead and rave and all that sort
of thing, would you still refuse him?”
</p>

<p>
She covered her face with her hands.  “O George,
George!” she cried.
</p>

<p>
“He will follow you, of course.  He will not let you
go so easily.”
</p>

<p>
“Possibly; but I have begged him solemnly to let me
take my way.  Roger is not one to rave and rage.  At
all events, I shall refuse to see him now.  A year hence
I will think of it.  His great desire will be, of course,
that I don’t suffer.  I shall not suffer.”
</p>

<p>
“By Jove, not if I can help it!” cried Fenton, with
warmth.  Nora answered with a faint, grave smile, and
stood looking at him in appealing silence.  He colored
beneath her glance with the pressure of his thoughts.
They resolved themselves chiefly into the recurring
question, “What can be made of it?”  While he was awaiting
inspiration, he took refuge in a somewhat inexpensive
piece of gallantry.  “By the way, you must be hungry.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I am not hungry,” said Nora, “but I am tired.
You must find me a lodging,—in some quiet hotel.”
</p>

<p>
“O, you shall be quiet enough,” he answered; but he
insisted that unless, meanwhile, she took some dinner, he
should have her ill on his hands.  They quitted the office,
and he hailed a hack, which drove them over to the upper
Broadway region, where they were soon established in a
well-appointed restaurant.  They made, however, no very
hearty meal.  Nora’s hunger of the morning had passed
away in fever, and Fenton himself was, as he would have
expressed it, off his feed.  Nora’s head had begun to
ache; she had removed her bonnet, and sat facing him
at their small table, leaning wearily against the wall, her
plate neglected, her arms folded, her bright expanded
eyes consulting the uncertain future.  He noted narrowly
how much prettier she was; but more even than by her
prettiness he was struck by her high spirit.  This
belonged to an order of things in which he felt no
commission to dabble; but in a creature of another sort he was
free to admire such a luxury of conscience.  In man or
woman the capacity then and there to act was the thing
he most relished.  Nora had not faltered and wavered;
she had chosen, and here she sat.  It was an irritation
to him to feel that he was not the manner of man for
whom such a girl would burn her ships; for, as he looked
askance at her beautiful absent eyes, he more than
suspected that there was a positive as well as a negative side
to her refusal of her friend.  Poor Roger had a happier
counterpart.  It was love, and not indifference, that had
pulled the wires of her adventure.  Fenton, as we have
intimated, was one who, when it suited him, could ride
rough-shod to his mark.  “You have told me half your
story,” he said, “but your eyes tell the rest.  You’ll not
be Roger’s wife, but you’ll not die an old maid.”
</p>

<p>
Nora blushed, but she answered simply, “Please don’t
say that.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear girl,” he said, “I religiously respect your
secrets.”  But, in truth, he only half respected them.
Stirred as he was by her beauty and by that sense of
feminine appealingness which may be an inspiring motive
even to a very shabby fellow, he was keenly mortified by
feeling that her tenderness passed him by, barely
touching him with the hem of its garment.  She was doing
mighty fine things, but she was using him, her hard,
vulgar cousin, as a senseless stepping-stone.  These
reflections quickened his appreciation of her charm, but took
the edge from his delicacy.  As they rose to go, Nora,
who in spite of her absent eyes had watched him well, felt
that cousinship had melted to a mere name.  George had
been to her maturer vision a painful disappointment.  His
face, from the moment of their meeting, had given her
warning to withdraw her trust.  Was it she or he who
had changed since that fervid youthful parting of sixteen
months before?  She, in the interval, had been refined
by life; he had been vulgarized.  She had seen the
world; she had known better things and better men; she
had known Hubert, and, more than ever, she had known
Roger.  But as she drew on her gloves she reflected with
horror that distress was making her fastidious.  She
wished to be coarse and careless; she wished that she
might have eaten a heavy dinner, that she might enjoy
taking George’s arm.  And the slower flowed the
current of her confidence, the softer dropped her words.
“Now, dear George,” she said, with a desperate attempt
at a cheerful smile, “let me know where you mean to
take me.”
</p>

<p>
“Upon my soul, Nora,” he said, with a hard grin, “I
feel as if I had a jewel I must lay in soft cotton.  The
thing is to find it soft enough.”  George himself, perhaps,
she might endure; but she had a growing horror of his
friends.  Among them, probably, were the female
correlatives of the “parties” who had come to chat with
Mr. Franks.  She prayed he might not treat her to company.
“You see I want to do the pretty thing,” he went on.
“I want to treat you, by Jove, as I would treat a queen!
I can’t thrust you all alone into an hotel, and I can’t put
up at one with you,—can I?”
</p>

<p>
“I am not in a position to be fastidious,” said Nora.
“I shall not object to going alone.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no!” he cried, with a flourish of his hand.  “I
will do for you what I would do for my own sister.  I am
not a fine gentleman, but I know what’s proper.  I live
in the house of a lady who lets out rooms,—a very nice
little woman; she and I are great cronies; I’m sure
you’ll like her.  She will give you the comforts of a
home, and all that sort of thing.”
</p>

<p>
Nora’s heart sank, but she assented.  They re-entered
their carriage, and a drive of moderate length brought
them to a brownstone dwelling of the third order of
gentility, as one may say, stationed in a cheap and serried
row.  In a few moments, in a small tawdry front parlor,
Nora was introduced to George’s hostess, the nice little
woman, Mrs. Paul by name.  Nice enough she seemed,
for Nora’s comfort.  She was young and fair, plump and
comely; she wore a great many ringlets.  She was a
trifle too loving on short acquaintance, perhaps; but,
after all, thought Nora, who was she now, to complain
of that?  When the two women had gone up stairs,
Fenton put on his hat,—he could never meditate without it
(he had written that last letter to Nora with his beaver
resting on the bridge of his nose),—and paced slowly
up and down the narrow entry, chewing the end of a
cigar, with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the
ground.  In ten minutes Mrs. Paul reappeared.  “Well,
sir,” she cried, “what does all this mean?”
</p>

<p>
“It means money, if you’ll not scream so loud,” he
answered.  “Come in here.”  They went into the parlor
and remained there for a couple of hours with closed
doors.  At last Fenton came forth and left the house.
He walked along the street, humming gently to himself.
Dusk had fallen; he stopped beneath a lighted lamp at
the corner, looked up and down a moment, and then
exhaled a deep, an almost melancholy sigh.  Having thus
relieved his conscience, he proceeded to business.  He
consulted his watch; it was five o’clock.  An empty hack
rolled by; he called it and got in, breathing the motto of
great spirits, “Confound the expense!”  His business
led him to visit successively several of the best hotels.
Roger, he argued, starting immediately in pursuit of
Nora, would have taken the first train from Boston, and
would now have been more than an hour in town.  Fenton
could, of course, proceed only by probabilities; but
according to these, Roger was to be found at one of the
establishments I have mentioned.  Fenton knew his New
York, and, from what he knew of Roger, he believed him
to be at the “quietest” of these.  Here, in fact, he found
his name freshly registered.  He would give him time,
however; he would take time himself.  He stretched his
long legs awhile on one of the divans in the hall.  At last
Roger appeared, strolling gloomily down the corridor,
with his eyes on the ground.  For a moment Fenton
scarcely recognized him.  He was pale and grave;
distress had already made him haggard.  Fenton observed
that, as he passed, people stared at him.  He walked
slowly to the street door; whereupon Fenton, fearing he
might lose him, followed him, and stood for a moment
behind him.  Roger turned suddenly, as if from an
instinct of the other’s nearness, and the two faced each
other.  Those dumb eyes of Roger’s for once were
eloquent.  They glowed like living coals.

<div class='chapter'><h2>X.</h2></div>

<p>
The good lady who enjoyed the sinecure of being
mother-in-law to Mrs. Keith passed on that
especial Sunday an exceptionally dull evening.
Her son’s widow was oppressed and preoccupied, and
took an early leave.  Mrs. Keith’s first question on
reaching home was as to whether Nora had left her
room.  On learning that she had quitted the house alone,
after dark, Mrs. Keith made her way, stirred by vague
conjecture, to the empty chamber, where, of course, she
speedily laid her hands on those two testamentary notes
to which allusion has been made.  In a moment she had
read the one addressed to herself.  Perturbed as she
was, she yet could not repress an impulse of intelligent
applause.  “Ah, how character plays the cards!” she
mused.  “How a good girl’s very errors set her off!”  If
Roger longed for Nora to-day, who could measure the
morrow’s longing?  He might enjoy, however, without
waiting for the morrow, this refinement of desire.  In
spite of the late hour, Mrs. Keith repaired to his abode,
armed with the other letter, deeming this, at such a
moment, a more gracious course than to send for him.  The
letter Roger found to be brief but pregnant.  “Dear
Roger,” it ran, “I learned this afternoon the secret of
all these years,—too late for our happiness.  I have
been strangely blind; you have been too forbearing,—generous
where you should have been strictly just.  I
never dreamed of what this day would bring.  Now, I
must leave you; I can do nothing else.  This is no time
to thank you for what you have been to me, but I shall
live to do so yet.  Dear Roger, get married, and send me
your children to teach.  I shall live by teaching.  I have
a family, you know; I go to New York to-night.  I write
this on my knees, imploring you to be happy.  One of
these days, when I have learned to be myself again, we
shall be better friends than ever.  I beg you, I beg you,
not to follow me.”
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith sat a long time with her host.  For the
first time in her knowledge of him she saw Roger
violent,—violent with horror and self-censure and vain
imprecation.  “Take her at her word,” she said; “don’t follow
her.  Let her knock against the world a little, and she
will have you yet.”
</p>

<p>
This philosophy seemed to Roger too stoical by half;
to sit at home and let Nora knock against the world was
more than he could undertake.  “Whether she will have
me or not,” he said, “I must bring her back.  I am
morally responsible for her.  Good God! think of her
afloat in that horrible city with that rascal of a
half-cousin—her ‘family’ she calls him!—for a pilot!”  He
took, of course, the first train to New York.  How
to proceed, where to look, was a hard question; but to
linger and waver was agony.  He was haunted, as he
went, with dreadful visions of what might have befallen
her; it seemed to him that he had never loved her before.
</p>

<p>
Fenton, as he recognized him, was a comfortable sight,
in spite of his detested identity.  He was better than
uncertainty.  “You have news for me!” Roger cried.
“Where is she?”
</p>

<p>
Fenton looked about him at his leisure, feeling,
agreeably, that now <i>he</i> held the cards.  “Gently,” he said.
“Hadn’t we better retire?”  Upon which Roger, grasping
his arm with grim devotion, led him to his own apartment.
“I rather hit it,” George went on.  “I am not
the fool you once tried to make me seem.”
</p>

<p>
“Where is she,—tell me that!” Roger repeated.
</p>

<p>
“Allow me, dear sir,” said Fenton, settling himself in
spacious vantage.  “If I have come here to oblige you,
you must let me take my own way.  You don’t suppose
I have rushed to meet you for the pleasure of the thing.
I owe it to my cousin, in the first place, to say that I
have come without her knowledge.”
</p>

<p>
“If you mean only to torture me,” Roger answered,
“say so outright.  Is she well? is she safe?”
</p>

<p>
“Safe? the safest creature in the city, sir!  A
delightful home, maternal care!”
</p>

<p>
Roger wondered whether Fenton was making horrible
sport of his trouble; he turned cold at the thought of
maternal care of his providing.  But he admonished
himself to lose nothing by arrogance.  “I thank you
extremely for your kindness.  Nothing remains but that I
should see her.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing, indeed!  You are very considerate.  You
know that she particularly objects to seeing you.”
</p>

<p>
“Possibly!  But that is for her to say.  I claim the
right to take the refusal from her own lips.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton looked at him with an impudent parody of
compassion.  “Don’t you think you have had refusals
enough?  You must enjoy them!”
</p>

<p>
Roger turned away with an imprecation, but he continued
to swallow his impatience.  “Mr. Fenton,” he
said, “you have not come here, I know, to waste words,
nor have I to waste temper.  You see before you a
desperate man.  Come, make the most of me!  I am
willing, I am delighted, to be fleeced!  You will help me,
but not for nothing.  Name your terms.”
</p>

<p>
Fenton flinched, but he did not protest; he only gave
himself the luxury of swaggering a little.  “Well, you
see,” he answered, “my assistance is worth something.
Let me explain how much.  You will never guess!  I
know your story; Nora has told me everything,—everything!
We have had a great talk.  Let me give you a
little hint of my story,—and excuse egotism!  You
proposed to her; she refused you.  You offered her money,
luxury, a position.  She knew you, she liked you
enormously, yet she refused you flat!  Now reflect on this.”
</p>

<p>
There was something revolting to Roger in seeing his
adversary profaning these sacred mysteries; he protested.
“I <i>have</i> reflected, quite enough.  You can tell me nothing.
Her affections,” he added stiffly, to make an end
of it, “were pre-engaged.”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly!  You see how that complicates matters.
Poor, dear little Nora!”  And Fenton gave a twist to
his mustache.  “Imagine, if you can, how a man placed
as I am feels toward a woman,—toward <i>the</i> woman!
If he reciprocates, it’s love, it’s passion, it’s what you
will, but it’s common enough!  But when he doesn’t
repay her in kind, when he can’t, poor devil, it’s—it’s—upon
my word,” cried Fenton, slapping his knee, “it’s
chivalry!”
</p>

<p>
For some moments Roger failed to appreciate the
remarkable purport of these observations; then, suddenly,
it dawned upon him.  “Do I understand you,” he asked,
in a voice gentle by force of wonder, “that you are the
man?”
</p>

<p>
Fenton squared himself in his chair.  “You have hit
it, sir.  I am the man,—the happy, the unhappy man.
D—n it, sir, it’s not my fault!”
</p>

<p>
Roger stood staring; Fenton felt his eyes penetrating
him to the core.  “Excuse me,” said Roger, at last, “if
I suggest your giving me some slight evidence in support
of this extraordinary claim!”
</p>

<p>
“Evidence? isn’t there about evidence enough?
When a young girl gives up home and friends and fortune
and—and reputation, and rushes out into the world
to throw herself into a man’s arms, it seems to me you
have got your evidence.  But if you’ll not take my word,
you may leave it!  I may look at the matter once too
often, let me tell you!  I admire Nora with all my heart;
I worship the ground she treads on; but I confess I’m
afraid of her; she’s too good for me; she was meant for
a finer gentleman than I!  By which I don’t mean you,
of necessity.  But you have been good to her, and you
have a claim.  It has been cancelled in a measure; but
you wish to set it up again.  Now you see that I stand
in your way; that if I had a mind to, I might stand
there forever!  Hang it, sir, I am playing the part of a
saint.  I have but a word to say to settle my case, and
to settle yours.  But I have my eye on a lady neither
so young nor so pretty as my cousin, yet whom I can
marry with a better conscience, for she expects no more
than I can give her.  Nevertheless, I don’t answer for
myself.  A man isn’t a saint every day in the week.
Talk about conscience when a beautiful girl sits gazing
at you through a mist of tears!  O, you have yourself to
thank for it all!  A year and a half ago, if you hadn’t
treated me like a swindler, Nora would have been content
to treat me like a friend.  But women have a fancy for
an outlaw.  You turned me out of doors, and Nora’s
heart went with me.  It has followed me ever since.
Here I sit with my ugly face and hold it in my hand.
As I say, I don’t quite know what to do with it.  You
propose an arrangement, I inquire your terms.  A man
loved is a man listened to.  If I were to say to Nora
to-morrow, ‘My dear girl, you have made a mistake.  You
are in a false position.  Go back to Mr. Lawrence
directly, and then we will talk about it!’ she would look
at me a moment with those beautiful eyes of hers, she
would sigh, she would gather herself up like a princess
on trial for treason, remanded to prison,—and she would
march to your door.  Once she’s within it, it’s your own
affair.  That’s what I can do.  Now what can you do?
Come, something handsome!”
</p>

<p>
Fenton spoke loud and fast, as if to outstrip self-contempt.
Roger listened amazedly to this tissue of falsity,
impudence, and greed, and at last, as Fenton paused, and
he seemed to see Nora’s very image turning away with
a shudder, his disgust broke forth.  “Upon my word,
sir,” he cried, “you go too far; you ask too much.
Nora in love with you,—you, who haven’t the grace
even to lie decently!  Tell me she’s ill, she’s lost, she’s
dead; but don’t tell me she can look at you without
horror!”
</p>

<p>
Fenton rose and stood for a moment, glaring with
anger at his useless self-exposure.  For an instant, Roger
expected a tussle.  But Fenton deemed that he could
deal harder vengeance than by his fists.  “Very good!”
he cried.  “You have chosen.  I don’t mind your words;
you’re an ass at best, and of course you are twenty times
an ass when you are put out by a disagreeable truth.
But you are not such a fool, I guess, as not to
repent!”  And Fenton made a rather braver exit than you might
have expected.
</p>

<p>
Roger’s recent vigil with Mrs. Keith had been dismal
enough; but he was yet to learn that a sleepless night
may contain deeper possibilities of suffering.  He had
flung back Fenton’s words, but they returned to the
charge.  When once the gate is opened to self-torture,
the whole army of fiends files in.  Before morning he had
fairly out-Fentoned Fenton.  There was no discretion in
his own love; why should there be in Nora’s?  We love
as we must, not as we should; and she, poor girl, might
have bowed to the common law.  In the morning he
slept awhile for weariness, but he awoke to a world of
agitation.  If Fenton’s tale was true, and if, at
Mrs. Keith’s instigation, his own suspicions had done Hubert
wrong, he would go to Hubert, pour out his woes, and
demand aid and comfort.  He must move to find rest.
Hubert’s lodging was far up town; Roger started on foot.
The weather was perfect; one of those happy days of
February which seem to snatch a mood from May,—a
day when any sorrow is twice a sorrow.  The winter was
melting and trickling; you heard on all sides, in the still
sunshine, the raising of windows; on the edges of opposing
house-tops rested a vault of vernal blue.  Where was
she hidden, in the vast bright city?  The streets and
crowds and houses that concealed her seemed hideous.
He would have beggared himself for the sound of her
voice, though her words might damn him.  When at last
he reached Hubert’s dwelling, a sudden sense of all that
he risked checked his steps.  Hubert, after all, and
Hubert alone, was a possible rival, and it would be sad
work to put the torch into his hands!  So he turned
heavily back to the Fifth Avenue and kept his way to the
Park.  Here, for some time he walked about, heeding,
feeling, seeing nothing but the glaring, mocking
brightness of the day.  At last he sat down on a bench; the
delicious mildness of the air almost sickened him.  It was
some time before he perceived through the mist of his
thoughts that two ladies had descended from a carriage
hard by, and were approaching his bench,—the only
one near at hand.  One of these ladies was of great age
and evidently infirm; she came slowly, leaning on her
companion’s arm; she wore a green shade over her eyes.
The younger lady, who was in the prime of youth and
beauty, supported her friend with peculiar tenderness.
As Roger rose to give them place, he dimly observed on
the young lady’s face a movement of recognition, a
smile,—the smile of Miss Sands!  Blushing slightly, she
frankly greeted him.  He met her with the best grace at
his command, and felt her eyes, as he spoke, scanning
the trouble in his aspect.  “There is no need of my
introducing you to my aunt,” she said.  “She has lost her
hearing, and her only pleasure is to bask in the sun.”  She
turned and helped this venerable invalid to settle
herself on the bench, put a shawl about her, and satisfied
her feeble needs with filial solicitude.  At the end of ten
minutes of commonplace talk, relieved however by certain
intelligent glances on either side, Roger found a kind of
healing quality in the presence of this agreeable woman.
At last these sympathetic eye-beams resolved themselves,
on Miss Sands’s part, into speech.  “You are either very
unwell, Mr. Lawrence, or very unhappy.”
</p>

<p>
Roger hesitated an instant, under the empire of that
stubborn aversion to complaint which, in his character,
was half modesty and half philosophy.  But Miss Sands
seemed to sit there eying him so like the genius of
friendship, that he answered simply, “I am unhappy!”
</p>

<p>
“I was afraid it would come!” said Miss Sands.  “It
seemed to me when we met, a year ago, that your spirits
were too high for this life.  You know you told me
something which gives me the right,—I was going to
say, to be interested; let me say, at least, to be
compassionate.”
</p>

<p>
“I hardly remember what I told you.  I only know
that I admired you to a degree which may very well
have loosened my tongue.”
</p>

<p>
“O, it was about the charms of another you spoke!
You told me about the young girl to whom you had
devoted yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“I was dreaming then; now I am awake!”  Roger
hung his head and poked the ground with his stick.
Suddenly he looked up, and she saw that his eyes were
filled with tears.  “Dear lady,” he said, “you have
stirred deep waters!  Don’t question me.  I am
ridiculous with disappointment and sorrow!”
</p>

<p>
She gently laid her hand upon his arm.  “Let me
hear it all!  I assure you I can’t go away and leave you
sitting here the same image of suicidal despair I found
you.”
</p>

<p>
Thus urged, Roger told his story.  Her attention
made him understand it better himself, and, as he talked,
he worked off the superficial disorder of his grief.  When
he came to speak of this dismal contingency of Nora’s
love for her cousin, he threw himself frankly upon Miss
Sands’ pity, upon her wisdom.  “Is such a thing
possible?” he asked.  “Do you believe it?”
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows.  “You must remember that
I know neither Miss Lambert nor the gentleman you speak
of.  I can hardly risk a judgment; I can only say this,
that the general effect of your story is to diminish my
esteem for women,—to elevate my opinion of men.”
</p>

<p>
“O, except Nora on one side, and Fenton on the
other!  Nora is an angel!”
</p>

<p>
Miss Sands gave a vexed smile.  “Possibly!  You
are a man, and you ought to have loved a woman.  Angels
have a good conscience guaranteed them; they may do
what they please.  If I should except any one, it would
be Mr. Hubert Lawrence.  I met him the other evening.”
</p>

<p>
“You think it is Hubert then?” Roger demanded
mournfully.
</p>

<p>
Miss Sands broke into a brilliant laugh.  “For an
angel, Miss Lambert hasn’t lost her time on earth!  But
don’t ask me for advice, Mr. Lawrence; at least not now
and here.  Come and see me to-morrow, or this evening.
Don’t regret having spoken; you may believe at least
that the burden of your grief is shared.  It was too
miserable that at such a time you should be sitting here
alone, feeding upon your own heart.”
</p>

<p>
These seemed to Roger excellent words; they lost
nothing on the speaker’s lips.  She was indeed extremely
beautiful; her face, softened by intelligent pity, was
lighted by a gleam of tender irony of his patience.  Was
he, after all, stupidly patient, ignobly fond?  There was
in Miss Sands something delightfully rich and mellow.
Nora, for an instant, seemed a flighty school-girl.  He
looked about him, vaguely questioning the empty air,
longing for rest, yet dreading forfeiture.  He left his
place and strolled across the dull-colored turf.  At the
base of a tree, on its little bed of sparse raw verdure, he
suddenly spied the first violet of the year.  He stooped
and picked it: its mild firm tint was the color of
friendship.  He brought it back to Miss Sands, who now had
risen with her companion and was preparing to return
to the carriage.  He silently offered her the violet,—a
mere pin’s head of bloom; a passionate throb of his heart
had told him that this was all he could offer her.  She
took it with a sober smile; it seemed to grow pale
beneath her dark blue eyes.  “We shall see you again?”
she said.
</p>

<p>
Roger felt himself blushing to his brows.  He had a
vision on either hand of an offered cup,—the deep-hued
wine of illusion,—the bitter draught of constancy.  A
certain passionate instinct answered,—an instinct deeper
than his wisdom, his reason, his virtue,—deep as his
love.  “Not now,” he said.  “A year hence!”
</p>

<p>
Miss Sands turned away and stood for a moment as
motionless as some sculptured statue of renunciation.
Then, passing her arm caressingly round her companion,
“Come, dear aunt,” she murmured: “we must go.”  This
little address to the stone-deaf dame was her single
tribute to confusion.  Roger walked with the ladies to
their carriage and silently helped them to enter it.  He
noted the affectionate tact with which Miss Sands
adjusted her movements to those of her companion.  When
he lifted his hat, his friend bowed, as he fancied, with an
air of redoubled compassion.  She had but imagined his
prior loss,—she knew his present one!  “She would
make an excellent wife!” he said, as the carriage rolled
away.  He stood watching it for some minutes; then, as
it wheeled round a turn, he was seized with a deeper,
sorer sense of his impotent idleness.  He would go to
Hubert with his accusation, if not with his appeal.

<div class='chapter'><h2>XI.</h2></div>

<p>
Nora, relieved of her hostess’s company, turned
the key in her door and went through certain
motions mechanically suggestive of her being at
rest and satisfied.  She unpacked her little bag and
repaired her disordered toilet.  She took out her inkstand
and prepared to write a letter to Miss Murray.  But she
had not written many words before she lapsed into
sombre thought.  Now that she had seen George again
and judged him, she was coming rapidly to feel that to
have exchanged Roger’s care for his care was, for the
time, to have paid a scanty compliment to Roger.  But
she took refuge from this reflection in her letter, and
begged for an immediate reply.  From time to time, as
she wrote, she heard a step in the house, which she
supposed to be George’s; it somehow quickened her pen
and the ardor of her petition.  This was just finished
when Mrs. Paul reappeared, bearing a salver charged
with tea and toast,—a gracious attention, which Nora
was unable to repudiate.  The lady took advantage of it
to open a conversation.  Mrs. Paul’s overtures, as well
as her tea and toast, were the result of her close
conference with Fenton; but though his instructions had made
a very pretty show as he laid them down, they dwindled
sensibly in the vivid glare of Nora’s mistrust.  Mrs. Paul,
nevertheless, seated herself bravely on the bed and rubbed
her plump pretty hands like the best little woman in the
world.  But the more Nora looked at her, the less she
liked her.  At the end of five minutes she had conceived
a horror of her comely stony face, her false smile, her
little tulle cap, her artificial ringlets.  Mrs. Paul called her
my dear, and tried to take her hand; Nora was afraid
that, the next thing, she would kiss her.  With a defiant
flourish, Nora addressed her letter with Miss Murray’s
venerated title: “I should like to have this posted,
please,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Give it to me, my dear; I will attend to it,” said
Mrs. Paul; and straightway read the address.  “I suppose
this is your old schoolmistress.  Mr. Fenton told
me all about it.”  Then, after turning the letter for a
moment, “Keep it over a day!”
</p>

<p>
“Not an hour,” said Nora, with decision, “My time
is precious.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, my dear,” said Mrs. Paul, “we shall be delighted
to keep you a month.”
</p>

<p>
“You are very good.  You know I have my living to make.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t talk about that!  I make <i>my</i> living,—I know
what it means!  Come, let me talk to you as a friend.
Don’t go too far.  Suppose, now, you take it all back?
Six months hence, it may be too late.  If you leave him
lamenting too long, he’ll marry the first pretty girl he
sees.  They always do,—a man refused is just like a
widower.  They’re not so faithful as the widows!  But
let me tell you it’s not every girl that gets such a chance;
I would have snapped at it.  He’ll love you the better,
you see, for your having led him a little dance.  But he
mustn’t dance too long!  Excuse the liberty I take;
but Mr. Fenton and I, you see, are great friends, and I
feel as if his cousin was my cousin.  Take back this letter
and give me just one word to post,—<i>Come</i>!  Poor little
man!  You must have a high opinion of men, my dear,
to play such a game with this one!”
</p>

<p>
If Roger had wished for a proof that Nora still cared
for him, he would have found it in the disgust she felt
at hearing Mrs. Paul undertake his case.  The young
girl colored with her sense of the defilement of sacred
things.  George, surely, for an hour, at least, might have
kept her story intact.  “Really, madam,” she answered,
“I can’t discuss this matter.  I am extremely obliged to
you.”  But Mrs. Paul was not to be so easily baffled.
Poor Roger, roaming helpless and hopeless, would have
been amazed to hear how warmly his cause was being
urged.  Nora, of course, made no attempt to argue the
case.  She waited till the lady had exhausted her
eloquence, and then, “I am a very obstinate person,” she
said; “you waste your words.  If you go any further I
shall take offence.”  And she rose, to signify that
Mrs. Paul might do likewise.  Mrs. Paul took the hint, but
in an instant she had turned about the hard reverse of
her fair face, in which defeated self-interest smirked
horribly.  “Bah! you’re a silly girl!” she cried; and
swept out of the room.  Nora, after this, determined to
avoid a second interview with George.  Her bad headache
furnished a sufficient pretext for escaping it.  Half
an hour later he knocked at her door; quite too loudly,
she thought, for good taste.  When she opened it, he
stood there, excited, angry, ill-disposed.  “I am sorry
you are ill,” he said: “but a night’s rest will put you
right.  I have seen Roger.”
</p>

<p>
“Roger! is he here?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, he’s here.  But he don’t know where you are.
Thank the Lord you left him! he’s a brute!”  Nora
would fain have learned more,—whether he was angry,
whether he was suffering, whether he had asked to see
her; but at these words she shut the door in her cousin’s
face.  She hardly dared think of what offered impertinence
this outbreak of Fenton’s was the rebound.  Her
night’s rest brought little comfort.  She wondered
whether Roger had supposed George to be her appointed
mediator, and asked herself whether it was not her duty
to see him once again and bid him a respectfully personal
farewell.  It was a long time after she rose before she
could bring herself to leave her room.  She had a vague
hope that if she delayed, her companions might have
gone out.  But in the dining-room, in spite of the late
hour, she found George gallantly awaiting her.  He had
apparently had the discretion to dismiss Mrs. Paul to the
background, and apologized for her absence by saying
that she had breakfasted long since and had left the
house.  He seemed to have slept off his wrath and was
full of brotherly <i>bonhomie</i>.  “I suppose you will want
to know about Roger,” he said, when they were seated
at breakfast.  “He had followed you directly, in spite of
your hope that he wouldn’t; but it was not to beg you
to come back.  He counts on your repentance, and he
expects you to break down and come to him on your
knees, to beg his pardon and promise never to do it
again.  Pretty terms to marry a man on, for a woman
of spirit!  But he doesn’t know his woman, does he,
Nora?  Do you know what he intimated? indeed, he
came right out with it.  That you and I want to make
a match!  That you’re in love with me, Miss, and ran
away to marry me.  That we expected him to forgive
us and endow us with a pile of money.  But he’ll not
forgive us,—not he!  We may starve, we and our brats,
before he looks at us.  Much obliged!  We shall thrive,
for many a year, as brother and sister, sha’n’t we, Nora,
and need neither his money nor his pardon?”
</p>

<p>
In reply to this speech, Nora sat staring in pale
amazement.  “Roger thought,” she at last found words to
say, “that it was to marry <i>you</i> I refused him,—to
marry <i>you</i> I came to New York?”
</p>

<p>
Fenton, with seven-and-twenty years of impudence at
his back, had received in his day snubs and shocks of
various shades of intensity; but he had never felt in his
face so chilling a blast of reprobation as this cold disgust
of Nora’s.  We know that the scorn of a lovely woman
makes cowards brave; it may do something towards
making knaves honest men.  “Upon my word, my
dear,” he cried, “I am sorry I hurt your feelings.  It
may be offensive, but it is true.”
</p>

<p>
Nora wished in after years she had been able to laugh
at this disclosure; to pretend, at least, to an exhilaration
she so little felt.  But she remained almost sternly silent,
with her eyes on her plate, stirring her tea.  Roger,
meanwhile, was walking about under this detestable
deception.  Let him think anything but that!  “What did
you reply,” she asked, “to this—to this—”
</p>

<p>
“To this handsome compliment?  I replied that I
only wished it were true; but that I feared I had no
such luck!  Upon which he told me to go to the Devil,—in
a tone which implied that he didn’t much care if
you went with me.”
</p>

<p>
Nora listened to this speech in freezing silence.
“Where is Roger?” she asked at last.
</p>

<p>
Fenton shot her a glance of harsh mistrust.  “Where
is he?  What do you want to know that for?”
</p>

<p>
“Where is he, please!” she simply repeated.  And
then, suddenly, she wondered how and where it was the
two men had happened to meet.  “Where did you find
him?” she went on.  “How did it happen?”
</p>

<p>
Fenton drained his cup of tea at one long gulp before
he answered.  “My dear Nora,” he said, “it’s all very
well to be modest, it’s all very well to be proud; but
take care you are not ungrateful!  I went purposely to
look him up.  I was convinced he would have followed
you to beg and implore you, as I supposed, to come back.
I wanted to say to him, ‘She’s safe, she’s happy, she’s
in the best hands.  Don’t waste your time, your words,
your hopes.  Give her rope.  Go quietly home and leave
things to me.  If she gets homesick, I will let you
know.’  You see I’m frank, Nora; that’s what I meant
to say.  But I was received with this broadside.  I
found a perfect bluster of injured vanity.  ‘You’re her
lover, she’s your mistress, and be d——d to both of
you!’”
</p>

<p>
That George deliberately lied Nora did not distinctly
say to herself, for she lacked practice in this range of
incrimination.  But she as little said to herself that this
could be the truth.  “I am not ungrateful,” she
answered firmly.  “But where was it?”
</p>

<p>
At this, George pushed back his chair.  “Where—where?
Don’t you believe me?  Do you want to go
and ask him if it’s true?  What is the matter with you,
anyway?  What are you up to?  Have you put yourself
into my hands, or not?”  A certain manly indignation
was now kindled in his breast; he was equally angry
with Roger, with Nora, and with himself; fate had
offered him an overdose of contumely, and he felt a
reckless, savage impulse to wring from the occasion that
compliment to his power which had been so rudely denied
to his delicacy.  “Are you using me simply as a vulgar
tool?  Don’t you care for me the least little bit?  Let
me suggest that for a girl in your—your ambiguous
position, you are several shades too proud.  Don’t go
back to Roger in a hurry!  You are not the immaculate
young person you were but two short days ago.  Who
am I, what am I, to the people whose opinion you care
for?  A very low fellow, my dear; and yet, in the eyes
of the world, you have certainly taken up with me.  If
you are not prepared to do more, you should have done
less.  Nora, Nora,” he went on, breaking into a vein
none the less revolting for being more ardent, “I confess
I don’t understand you!  But the more you puzzle me
the more you fascinate me; and the less you like me the
more I love you.  What has there been, anyway,
between you and Lawrence?  Hang me if I can understand!
Are you an angel of purity, or are you the most
audacious of flirts?”
</p>

<p>
She had risen before he had gone far.  “Spare me,”
she said, “the necessity of hearing your opinions or
answering your questions.  Please be a gentleman!  Tell
me, I once more beg of you, where Roger is to be
found?”
</p>

<p>
“Be a gentleman!” was a galling touch.  He placed
himself before the door.  “I refuse the information,” he
said.  “I don’t mean to have been played with, to have
been buffeted hither by Roger and thither by you!  I mean
to make something out of all this.  I mean to request you
to remain quietly in this room.  Mrs. Paul will keep you
company.  You didn’t treat her over well, yesterday;
but, in her way, she is quite as strong as you.  Meanwhile
I shall go to our friend.  ‘She’s locked up tight,’
I will say; ‘she’s as good as in jail.  Give me five
thousand dollars and I’ll let her out.’  Of course he will
begin to talk about legal proceedings.  Then I will tell him
that he is welcome to take legal proceedings if he doesn’t
mind the exposure.  The exposure won’t be pleasant for
you, Nora, you know; for the public takes things in the
lump.  It won’t hurt me!”
</p>

<p>
“Heaven forgive you!” murmured Nora, for all response
to this explosion.  It made a hideous whirl about
her; but she felt that to advance in the face of it was
her best safety.  It sickened rather than frightened her.
She went to the door.  “Let me pass!” she said.
</p>

<p>
Fenton stood motionless, leaning his head against the
door, with his eyes closed.  She faced him a moment,
looking at him intently.  He seemed ineffably repulsive.
“Coward!” she cried.  He opened his eyes at the sound;
for an instant they met hers; then a burning blush
blazed out strangely on his dead complexion; he strode
past her, dropped into a chair, and buried his face in his
hands.  “O Lord!” he cried.  “I am an ass!”
</p>

<p>
Nora made it the work of a single moment to reach
her own room and fling on her bonnet and shawl, of
another to descend to the hall door.  Once in the street
she never stopped running till she had turned a corner
and put the house out of sight.  She went far, hurried
along by the ecstasy of relief and escape, and it was some
time before she perceived that this was but half the
question, and that she was now quite without refuge.
Thrusting her hand into her pocket to feel for her purse, she
found that she had left it in her room.  Stunned and
sickened as she was already, it can hardly be said that
the discovery added to her grief.  She was being precipitated
toward a great decision; sooner or later made little
difference.  The thought of seeing Hubert Lawrence
had now taken possession of her.  Reserve, prudence,
mistrust, had melted away; she was mindful only of her
trouble, of his nearness, and of the way he had once talked
to her.  His address she well remembered, and she
neither paused nor faltered.  To say even that she
reflected would be to speak amiss, for her longing and her
haste were one.  Between them both it was with a
beating heart that she reached his door.  The servant
admitted her without visible surprise (for Nora wore, as
she conceived, the air of some needy parishioner) and
ushered her into his bachelor’s parlor.  As she crossed
the threshold, she perceived with something both of
regret and of relief, that he was not alone.  He was sitting
somewhat stiffly, with folded arms, facing the window,
near which, before an easel, stood a long-haired gentleman
of foreign and artistic aspect, giving the finishing touches
to a portrait in crayons.  Hubert was in position for a
likeness of his handsome face.  When Nora appeared, his
handsome face remained for a moment a blank; the next
it turned most eloquently pale.  “Miss Lambert!” he
cried.
</p>

<p>
There was such a tremor in his voice that Nora felt
that, for the moment, she must have self-possession for
both.  “I interrupt you,” she said with extreme deference.
</p>

<p>
“We are just finishing!” Hubert answered.  “It is
my portrait, you see.  You must look at it.”  The artist
made way for her before the easel, laid down his
implements, and took up his hat and gloves.  She looked
mechanically at the picture, while Hubert accompanied him
to the door, and they talked awhile about another sitting,
and about a frame that was to be sent home.  The portrait
was clever, but superficial; better looking, at once,
and worse looking than Hubert,—elegant, effeminate,
unreal.  An impulse of wonder passed through her mind
that she should happen just then to find him engaged in
this odd self-reproduction.  It was a different Hubert
that turned and faced her as the door closed behind
his companion, the real, the familiar Hubert.  He had
gained time; but surprise, admiration, conjecture, a lively
suggestion of dismay, were shining in his handsome
eyes.  Nora had dropped into the chair vacated by the
artist; and as she sat there with clasped hands, she felt
the young man reading the riddle of her shabby dress
and her excited face.  For him, too, she was the real
Nora.  Dismay in Hubert’s face began to elbow its
companions.  He advanced, pushed towards her the chair in
which he had been posturing, and, as he seated himself,
made a half-movement to offer his hand; but before she
could take it, he had begun to play with his watch-chain.
“Nora,” he asked, “what is it?”
</p>

<p>
What was it, indeed?  What was her errand, and in
what words could it be told?  An inexpressible weakness
had taken possession of her, a sense of having reached
the goal of her journey, the term of her strength.  She
dropped her eyes on her shabby skirt and passed her
hand over it with a gesture of eloquent simplicity.  “I
have left Roger,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Hubert made no answer, but his silence seemed to fill
the room.  He sank back in his chair, still looking at
her with startled eyes.  The fact intimidated him; he
was amazed and confused; yet he felt he must say something,
and in his confusion he uttered a gross absurdity.
“Ah,” he said: “with his consent?”
</p>

<p>
The sound of his voice was so grateful to her that, at
first, she hardly heeded his words.  “I am alone,” she
added, “I am free.”  It was after she had spoken, as
she saw him, growing, to his own sense, infinitely small
in the large confidence of her gaze, rise in a kind of
agony of indecision and stand before her, stupidly staring,
that she felt he had neither taken her hand, nor dropped
at her feet, nor divinely guessed her trouble; that, in
fact, his very silence was a summons to tell her story and
justify herself.  Her presence there was either a rapture or
a shame.  Nora felt as if she had taken a jump, and was
learning in mid-air that the distance was tenfold what she
had imagined.  It is strange how the hinging-point of great
emotions may rest on an instant of time.  These instants,
however, seem as ages, viewed from within; and in such
a reverberating moment Nora felt something that she had
believed to be a passion melting from beneath her feet,
crumbling and crashing into the gulf on whose edge she
stood.  But her shame at least should be brief.  She
rose and bridged this dizzy chasm with some tragic
counterfeit of a smile.  “I have come—I have come—”  She
began and faltered.  It was a pity some great actress
had not been there to note upon the tablets of her
art the light, all-eloquent tremor of tone with which she
transposed her embarrassment into the petition, “Could
you lend me a little money?”
</p>

<p>
Hubert was simply afraid of her.  All his falsity, all
his levity, all his egotism and sophism, seemed to crowd
upon him and accuse him in deafening chorus; he seemed
exposed and dishonored.  It was with an immense sense
of relief that he heard her ask this simple favor.  Money?
Would money buy his release?  He took out his purse
and grasped a roll of bills; then suddenly he was
overwhelmed by a sense of his cruelty.  He flung the thing
on the floor, and passed his hands over his face.  “Nora,
Nora,” he cried, “say it outright; you despise me!”
</p>

<p>
He had become, in the brief space of a moment, the
man she once had loved; but if he was no longer the
rose, he stood too near it to be wantonly bruised.  Men
and women alike need in some degree to respect those
they have suffered to wrong them.  She stooped and
picked up the porte-monnaie, like a beggar-maid in a
ballad.  “A very little will do,” she said.  “In a day
or two I hope to be independent.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me at least what has happened!” he cried.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment.  “Roger has asked me to be
his wife.”  Hubert’s head swam with the vision of all
that this simple statement embodied and implied.  “I
refused,” Nora added, “and, having refused, I was
unwilling to live any longer on his—on his—”  Her
speech at the last word melted into silence, and she
seemed to fall a-musing.  But in an instant she recovered
herself.  “I remember your once saying that you would
have liked to see me poor and homeless.  Here I am!
You ought at least,” she added with a laugh, “to pay for
the exhibition!”
</p>

<p>
Hubert abruptly drew out his watch.  “I expect here
at any moment,” he said, “a young lady of whom you
may have heard.  She is to come and see my portrait.
I am engaged to marry her.  I was engaged to marry
her five months ago.  She is rich, pretty, charming.  Say
but a single word, that you don’t despise me, that you
forgive me, and I will give her up, now, here, forever,
and be anything you will take me for,—your husband,
your friend, your slave!”  To have been able to make
this speech gave Hubert immense relief.  He felt almost
himself again.
</p>

<p>
Nora fixed her eyes on him, with a kind of unfathomable
gentleness.  “You are engaged, you were engaged?  How
strangely you talk about giving her up!  Give her my
compliments!”  It seemed, however, that Nora was to have
the chance of offering her compliments personally.  The
door was thrown open and admitted two ladies whom Nora
vaguely remembered to have seen.  In a moment she
recognized them as the persons whom, on the evening she
had gone to hear Hubert preach, he had left her, after
the sermon, to conduct to their carriage.  The younger
one was decidedly pretty, in spite of a nose a trifle too
aquiline.  A pair of imperious dark eyes, as bright as the
diamond which glittered in each of her ears, and a
nervous, capricious rapidity of motion and gesture, gave her
an air of girlish brusquerie, which was by no means without
charm.  Her mother’s aspect, however, testified to its
being as well to enjoy this charm at a distance.  She was
a stout, coarse-featured, good-natured woman, with a
jaded, submissive expression, and seemed to proclaim by
a certain ponderous docility, as she followed in her
daughter’s wake, the subserviency of matter to mind.
Both ladies were dressed to the uttermost limit of
opportunity.  They came into the room staring frankly at
Nora, and overlooking Hubert, with a gracious implication
of his being already one of the family.  The situation
was a trying one, but he faced it as he might.
</p>

<p>
“This is Miss Lambert,” he said gravely; and then
with an effort to dissipate embarrassment by a jest,
waving his hand toward his portrait, “This is the Reverend
Hubert Lawrence!”
</p>

<p>
The elder lady moved toward the picture, but the other
came straight to Nora.  “I have seen you before!” she
cried defiantly, and with defiance in her pretty eyes.
“And I have heard of you too!  Yes, you are certainly
very handsome.  But pray, what are you doing here?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear child!” said Hubert, imploringly, and with
a burning side-glance at Nora.  The world seemed to
him certainly very cruel.
</p>

<p>
“My dear Hubert,” said the young lady, “what is she
doing here?  I have a right to know.  Have you come
running after him even here?  You are a wicked girl.
You have done me a wrong.  You have tried to turn him
away from me.  You kept him in Boston for weeks,
when he ought to have been here; when I was writing to
him day after day to come.  I heard all about it!  I
don’t know what is the matter with you.  I thought you
were so very well off!  You look very poor and unhappy,
but I must say what I think!”
</p>

<p>
“My own darling, be reasonable!” murmured her
mother.  “Come and look at this beautiful picture.
There’s no deceit in that noble face!”
</p>

<p>
Nora smiled charitably.  “Don’t attack me,” she said.
“If I ever wronged you, I was quite unconscious of it,
and I beg your pardon now.”
</p>

<p>
“Nora,” murmured Hubert, piteously, “spare me!”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, does he call you Nora?” cried the young lady.
“The harm’s done, madam!  He will never be what he was.
You have changed, Hubert!”  And she turned passionately
upon her intended.  “You know you have!  You
talk to me, but you think of her.  And what is the
meaning of this visit?  You are both strangely excited;
what have you been talking about?”
</p>

<p>
“Mr. Lawrence has been telling me about you,” said
Nora: “how pretty, how charming, how gentle you are!”
</p>

<p>
“I am not gentle!” cried the other.  “You are laughing
at me!  Was it to talk about my prettiness you came
here?  Do you go about alone, this way?  I never heard
of such a thing.  You are shameless! do you know that?
But I am very glad of it; because once you have done
this for him, he will not care for you.  That’s the way
with men.  And I am not pretty either, not as you are!
You are pale and tired; you have got a horrid dress and
shawl, and yet you are beautiful!  Is that the way I
must look to please you?” she demanded, turning back
to Hubert.
</p>

<p>
Hubert, during this rancorous <i>tirade</i>, had stood looking
as dark as thunder, and at this point he broke out
fiercely, “Good God, Amy! hold your tongue,—I
command you.”
</p>

<p>
Nora, gathering her shawl together, gave Hubert a
glance.  “She loves you,” she said, softly.
</p>

<p>
Amy stared a moment at this vehement adjuration;
then she melted into a smile and turned in ecstasy to her
mother.  “O, did you hear that?” she cried.  “That’s
how I like him.  Please say it again!”
</p>

<p>
Nora left the room; and, in spite of her gesture of
earnest deprecation, Hubert followed her down stairs to
the street.  “Where are you going?” he asked in a
whisper.  “With whom are you staying?”
</p>

<p>
“I am alone,” said Nora.
</p>

<p>
“Alone in this great city?  Nora, I <i>will</i> do something
for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Hubert,” she said, “I never in my life needed help
less than at this moment.  Farewell.”  He fancied for
an instant that she was going to offer him her hand, but
she only motioned him to open the door.  He did so, and
she passed out.
</p>

<p>
She stood there on the pavement, strangely, almost
absurdly, free and light of spirit.  She knew neither
whither she should turn nor what she should do, yet the
fears which had haunted her for a whole day and night
had vanished.  The sky was blazing blue overhead; the
opposite side of the street was all in sun; she hailed the
joyous brightness of the day with a kind of answering
joy.  She seemed to be in the secret of the universe.  A
nursery-maid came along, pushing a baby in a perambulator.
She stooped and greeted the child, and talked
pretty nonsense to it with a fervor which left the young
woman staring.  Nurse and child went their way, and
Nora lingered, looking up and down the empty street.
Suddenly a gentleman turned into it from the cross-street
above.  He was walking fast; he had his hat in his hand,
and with his other hand he was passing his handkerchief
over his forehead.  As she stood and watched him draw
near, down the bright vista of the street, there came upon
her a singular and altogether nameless sensation, strangely
similar to the one she had felt a couple of years before,
when a physician had given her a dose of ether.  The
gentleman, she perceived, was Roger; but the short
interval of space and time which separated them seemed to
expand into a throbbing immensity and eternity.  She
seemed to be watching him for an age, and, as she did so,
to be floating through the whole circle of emotion and the
full realization of being.  Yes, she was in the secret of
the universe, and the secret of the universe was, that
Roger was the only man in it who had a heart.  Suddenly
she felt a palpable grasp.  Roger stood before her,
and had taken her hand.  For a moment he said nothing;
but the touch of his hand spoke loud.  They stood for
an instant scanning the change in each other’s faces.
“Where are you going?” said Roger, at last, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
Nora read silently in his haggard eyes the whole record
of his suffering.  It is a strange truth that this seemed
the most beautiful thing she had ever looked upon; the
sight of it was delicious.  It seemed to whisper louder
and louder that secret about Roger’s heart.
</p>

<p>
Nora collected herself as solemnly as one on a deathbed
making a will; but Roger was still in miserable
doubt and dread.  “I have followed you,” he said, “in
spite of that request in your letter.”
</p>

<p>
“Have you got my letter?” Nora asked.
</p>

<p>
“It was the only thing you had left me,” he said, and
drew it forth, creased and crumpled.
</p>

<p>
She took it from him and thrust it into the pocket of
her dress, never taking her eyes off his own.  “Don’t
try and forget that I wrote it,” she said.  “I want you
to see me burn it up, and to remember that.”
</p>

<p>
“What does it mean, Nora?” he asked, in hardly
audible tones.
</p>

<p>
“It means that I am a wiser girl to-day than <i>then</i>.  I
know myself better, I know you better.  O Roger!”
she cried, “it means everything!”
</p>

<p>
He passed her hand through his arm and held it there
against his heart, while he stood looking hard at the
pavement, as if to steady himself amid this great
convulsion of things.  Then raising his head, “Come,” he said;
“come!”
</p>

<p>
But she detained him, laying her other hand on his
arm.  “No; you must understand first.  If I am wiser
now, I have learnt wisdom at my cost.  I am not the girl
you proposed to on Sunday.  I feel—I feel <i>dishonored</i>!”
she said, uttering the word with a vehemence
that stirred his soul to its depths.
</p>

<p>
“My own poor child!” he murmured, staring.
</p>

<p>
“There is a young girl in that house,” Nora went on,
“who will tell you that I am shameless!”
</p>

<p>
“What house? what young girl?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know her name.  Hubert is engaged to
marry her.”
</p>

<p>
Roger gave a glance at the house behind them, as if
to fling defiance and oblivion upon all that it suggested
and contained.  Then turning to Nora with a smile of
exquisite tenderness: “My dear Nora, what have we to
do with Hubert’s young girls?”
</p>

<p>
Roger, the reader will admit, was on a level with the
occasion,—as with every other occasion that subsequently
presented itself.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keith and Mrs. Lawrence are very good friends.
On being complimented on possessing the confidence of
so charming a woman as Mrs. Lawrence, Mrs. Keith has
been known to say, opening and shutting her fan, “The
fact is, Nora is under a very peculiar obligation to me!”
